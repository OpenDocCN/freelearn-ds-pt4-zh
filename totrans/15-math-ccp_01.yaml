    <st c="81">This is a book about mathematics.</st> <st c="115">And mathematics
    is a language.</st> <st c="146">It is the language of science, and so it is the
    language of data science as well.</st> <st c="228">We can say beautiful things
    with that language.</st> <st c="276">Just as a piece of great literature is more
    than a large collection of individual letters, a mathematical equation is more
    than just a collection of symbols.</st> <st c="434">An equation conveys a way
    of thinking about a data science problem.</st> <st c="502">It conveys a concept
    or an idea.</st> <st c="535">If you want to fully exploit the power of those ideas
    and adapt them to your own data science work, you need to move beyond just recognizing
    the symbols in an equation and move towards understanding what that equation is
    really</st> <st c="763">telling you.</st>

    navigate mathematical equations and ideas on your own.</st> <st c="1244">We do
    that by walking you through the core concepts that underpin many data science
    algorithms – the 15 math concepts of the book’s title.</st> <st c="1383">We also
    do that by walking through those concepts slowly and in detail.</st> <st c="1455">I
    am not a fan of mathematics books that consist solely of theorems, lemmas, and
    proofs.</st> <st c="1544">Instead, this book is unapologetically long-form math.</st>
    <st c="1599">When we introduce an equation, we will explain what the equation
    tells us, what its implications and ramifications are, and how it connects to
    other parts of math.</st> <st c="1763">We also illustrate those concepts with
    code examples</st> <st c="1816">in Python.</st>
