			<p><st c="2192">If you </st><a id="_idIndexMarker105"/><st c="2200">read only one chapter in this book, read this one. </st><st c="2251">Why? </st><st c="2256">Well, because it explains the most important math concept in data science – all data is random. </st><st c="2352">Or, more precisely, all data contains a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2392">random component.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="2409">Is this really the case? </st><st c="2435">Let’s explain. </st><st c="2450">To start, we must explain what we mean by random. </st><st c="2500">I’m not going to give some dry technical definition here, expressed in mathematical symbols. </st><st c="2593">I’m going to give a technical, but intuitive definition: </st><em class="italic"><st c="2650">random </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="2657">means non-predictable</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="2678">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="2679">What do we mean by that? </st><st c="2705">Precisely what it says. </st><st c="2729">If something is random, it can’t be computed or calculated </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2788">in advance.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/><st c="2799">A little example</st></h2>
			<p><st c="2816">I have an</st><a id="_idIndexMarker106"/><st c="2826"> old ship’s barometer that belonged to my father (he was a ship’s captain). </st><st c="2902">The barometer is damaged and a bit temperamental, so the measurement is imprecise. </st><st c="2985">This means the measured atmospheric pressure is not the same as the actual atmospheric pressure but deviates from it, possibly by as much as +/- 40 mbar. </st><st c="3139">We can capture the idea of that deviation in the following </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3198">schematic equation:</st></span></p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"><st c="3217">Measured atmospheric pressure = True atmospheric pressure + Measurement ‘Noise</st><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/><st c="3296">’</st></p>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><st c="3298">Eq. </st><st c="3302">1</st></p>
			<p><st c="3303">I have referred </st><a id="_idIndexMarker107"/><st c="3319">to this as a schematic equation because it expresses a key concept. </st><st c="3387">The data we have, the measured pressure, deviates from what we’d like to know – the true pressure – due to the addition of the random measurement noise. </st><st c="3540">So, the data (the observation) contains a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3582">random component.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="3599">Sometimes, we also refer to measurement noise as measurement error or just error. </st><st c="3682">In fact, </st><em class="italic"><st c="3691">error</st></em><st c="3696"> is a word used a lot to describe the random component in data. </st><st c="3760">Sometimes we will also use the word </st><em class="italic"><st c="3796">stochastic</st></em><st c="3806"> instead of random, so you may see the terms </st><em class="italic"><st c="3851">random error</st></em><st c="3863">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="3865">random component</st></em><st c="3881">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="3883">stochastic error</st></em><st c="3899">, and </st><em class="italic"><st c="3905">stochastic component</st></em> <span class="No-Break"><st c="3925">used interchangeably.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="3947">You may say, “</st><em class="italic"><st c="3962">But that measurement error is just because you’re using an old barometer. </st><st c="4037">If you were just using a modern digital barometer, the error in the pressure measurement would be inconsequential</st></em><st c="4150">.” True, but measurement error would still be there because we have to use some proxy physical process by which the force of the atmosphere is transferred to some other object whose change we can measure. </st><st c="4355">Philosophically, what matters is that the error is there. </st><st c="4413">One of our jobs as data scientists is to assess/quantify the scale of the error and determine how consequential </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4525">it is.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="4531">One thing we should emphasize is that the use of the word </st><em class="italic"><st c="4590">error</st></em><st c="4595"> does not imply a mistake has been made. </st><st c="4636">It simply implies that there is a difference between the measurement and the true value. </st><st c="4725">In our preceding example, the use of the word </st><em class="italic"><st c="4771">error</st></em><st c="4776"> means there is a difference between the measured pressure and the true (and unobserved) pressure. </st><st c="4875">That difference is natural, and we understand why it comes about. </st><st c="4941">No mistake has been made. </st><st c="4967">Measurement error is a natural consequence of the fact that we measure things via proxy physical processes; for example, the atmosphere exerting pressure indirectly on a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5137">metal spring.</st></span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="5150">Pro tip</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="5158">On this point about what we mean, as data scientists, when we use the word </st><em class="italic"><st c="5234">error</st></em><st c="5239">, be careful. </st><st c="5253">Don’t use the word </st><em class="italic"><st c="5272">error</st></em><st c="5277"> when talking to non-data science stakeholders, or be very careful using it. </st><st c="5354">A non-data scientist may hear </st><em class="italic"><st c="5384">mistake</st></em><st c="5391"> when you use the word </st><em class="italic"><st c="5414">error</st></em><st c="5419">. So, instead, I tend to explain using words such as </st><em class="italic"><st c="5472">deviation</st></em> <span class="No-Break"><st c="5481">or </st></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="5485">difference</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="5495">.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="7070">What the solid line</st><a id="_idIndexMarker109"/><st c="7090"> on the scatterplot does show, though, is that there is something about the ship’s barometer measurement that can be predicted – its average behavior. </st><st c="7241">The average ship’s barometer measurement is the same as the true pressure, and so it varies systematically with the true pressure. </st><st c="7372">It is this average or systematic behavior that an ML algorithm could learn and would learn with increasing accuracy as we used an increasing amount of training data. </st><st c="7538">An alternative schematic way of writing </st><em class="italic"><st c="7578">Eq. </st><st c="7582">1</st></em><st c="7583"> would be </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7593">the following:</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="9442">Despite there</st><a id="_idIndexMarker111"/><st c="9456"> being a strong deterministic element to how I make my choice of drink in the morning, there is a large random variability in the outcome because my choice is now largely determined by the whim of my cat’s behavior the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9675">night before.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9688">This example highlights three </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9719">important things:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="9736">The random component within data is not necessarily additive. </st><st c="9799">Random variation does not always present itself in the form of </st><em class="italic"><st c="9862">Eq. </st><st c="9866">2</st></em><st c="9867">. Instead, random variation can be variation in the chosen outcome. </st><st c="9935">The potential outcomes may have well-defined long-run frequencies of occurrence, but any single instance of an outcome is unpredictable – that is, random – because in this example, on any particular night, I don’t know what my cat is going </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10175">to do.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="10181">What we consider to be random can be a matter of modeling choice. </st><st c="10248">I’ve said my morning drink is essentially determined by what my cat did the night before. </st><st c="10338">Now, you may think that my cat’s behavior could potentially be predicted. </st><st c="10412">Personally, I doubt it, but let’s say that in theory, it could. </st><st c="10476">However, whatever equations are determining my cat’s behavior, they must be so complex as to give the appearance of something almost random because I have yet to work my cat out. </st><st c="10655">What this illustrates is that sometimes we have variation in data that is systematic – meaning it is deterministic in nature and could in principle be predicted in advance – but that systematic variation is so complex, or its deterministic causes hidden from us, that we choose to view that variation as effectively being random and we model it </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11000">as such.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="11008">Wherever </st><a id="_idIndexMarker112"/><st c="11018">human decisions are involved, we have random variability in outcomes, and that variability can be marked. </st><st c="11124">When modeling datasets of human decisions, understanding this </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11186">is important.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/><st c="11199">What are the consequences of data being random?</st></h2>
			<p><st c="11247">Okay – so I may</st><a id="_idIndexMarker113"/><st c="11263"> have convinced you that all data contains some random component. </st><st c="11329">So what? </st><st c="11338">Why is this important for data science? </st><st c="11378">Unfortunately, if our starting data has some random variation within it, then so does everything we derive from that data. </st><st c="11501">This means every downstream quantity we calculate. </st><st c="11552">And I mean everything – every average value calculated from a dataset, every loss-function value we calculate from a dataset when training an ML algorithm, every parameter value of a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="11735">deep learning</st></strong><st c="11748"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="11750">DL</st></strong><st c="11752">) </st><strong class="bold"><st c="11755">neural network</st></strong><st c="11769"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="11771">NN</st></strong><st c="11773">) trained using a dataset, every single ML metric </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11824">we calculate.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="11837">If the random variation within data affects every single calculation we do in data science, we’d better learn how to handle this random variation. </st><st c="11985">The rest of this chapter is devoted to giving you the mathematical tools and language to do just that. </st><st c="12088">But it will first require learning some new concepts, so this is a good place to finish this section and recap what we </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12207">have learned.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/><st c="12220">What we learned</st></h2>
			<p><st c="12236">In this section, we have learned </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12270">the following:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="12284">All data we will work with as data scientists has a random component </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12354">to it</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="12359">Because of this randomness in data, all quantities derived from data also contain a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12444">random component</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="12460">Only the non-random or systematic variation in a dataset is learnable by a data </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12541">science algorithm</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="12558">Sometimes, parts of the systematic variation in a dataset will be hidden from us – we will be unaware that the variation is systematic, and so because of our ignorance we will treat it </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12744">as random</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="12753">Sometimes, parts of the systematic variation in a dataset will be so complex that we deliberately choose to treat it as </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12874">effectively random</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="12892">Having learned how randomness appears in all datasets we work with as data scientists, in the next section, we move on to how we describe and quantify </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13044">that randomness.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/><st c="13060">Random variables and probability distributions</st></h1>
			<p><st c="13107">We start this section by introducing a new concept that is necessary to describe the randomness we find </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13212">in data.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/><st c="13220">A new concept – random variables</st></h2>
			<p><st c="13253">In </st><a id="_idIndexMarker114"/><st c="13257">computer code, when we want to use a variable, we type something such as </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="13330">x=5</st></strong><st c="13333">. In many programming languages, we may change the value of the variable </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="13406">x</st></strong><st c="13407">. We even use the word </st><em class="italic"><st c="13430">variable</st></em><st c="13438"> to indicate that its value may change. </st><st c="13478">However, those changes are caused by us or by code we have written, and so typically they happen in a deterministic way; that is, we compute when the changes should happen, and we can compute the new value of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="13687">the variable.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="13700">For data that contains a random component, we need a new concept. </st><st c="13767">Remember – random means non-predictable. </st><st c="13808">When we record, observe, or capture the value of that variable, its value is not pre-determined. </st><st c="13905">Instead, it could take on a number of values. </st><st c="13951">The new concept we need is that of a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="13988">random variable</st></strong><st c="14003">.  A random variable is a variable, but its value when measured can be one of many different potential outcomes, each occurring with different probabilities. </st><st c="14160">For example, the hot drink I will choose tomorrow morning is a random variable with two possible outcomes (tea or coffee) with probabilities of 0.4 and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14312">0.6, respectively.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="14330">Listing the possible outcomes of a random variable and their associated probabilities gives us all the information we need to work with that random variable. </st><st c="14489">We call this set of probabilities a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="14525">probability distribution</st></strong><st c="14549">.

			<p><st c="58878">Unfortunately, the underlying population distribution from which a dataset is generated is usually hidden from us. </st><st c="58994">Instead, we use the sampled data as a proxy for the underlying population and use the summary characteristics of the sample as proxies for their population counterparts. </st><st c="59164">Due to randomness, no sample is a perfect copy of the underlying population distribution from which it was taken. </st><st c="59278">Consequently, different samples (datasets) taken from the same population can have different characteristics. </st><st c="59388">This is </st><a id="_idIndexMarker187"/><st c="59396">called </st><strong class="bold"><st c="59403">sampling variation</st></strong><st c="59421"> and can lead us to different conclusions if we don’t know how to correctly account for this randomness inherent in any sample. </st><st c="59549">Alternatively, an individual dataset can give misleading conclusions about the underlying population if we analyze it naively and aren’t aware of the random nature of the data. </st><st c="59726">This is why we have spent a lot of effort on understanding randomness, random variables, and </st><a id="_idIndexMarker188"/><st c="59819">distributions and why we consider this to be the most important chapter in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="59894">the book.</st></span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/><st c="62454">How big is the population from which a dataset is sampled?</st></h2>
			<p><st c="62513">In theoretical </st><a id="_idIndexMarker190"/><st c="62529">situations, we can usually consider the population to be of infinite size, meaning that I can obtain finite-sized sample datasets from it as big as I want. </st><st c="62685">In real-world situations, the population may also be of finite size due to genuine constraints. </st><st c="62781">For example, in our CTR example, we have 10 million visitors a year to the website, so the largest sample I could study in a year would consist of 10 million people. </st><st c="62947">Often, even if the true population is of finite size, it is so big compared to the typical dataset (sample) we will study that we can consider the population to be effectively infinite and ignore the finite size implications of the population. </st><st c="63191">However, I say this to point out that sometimes, we can’t ignore the finite size of the population from which we are drawing our samples, and so it is always worth thinking about this aspect; that is, how big is our sample and how big do we think the population is from which the sample </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="63478">was obtained.</st></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><st c="63840">We can use sampling to create simulated data. </st><st c="63887">Simulated data can be used to test data science algorithms and is particularly useful where we don’t have any existing real ground-truth data. </st><st c="64030">We can use the simulation process to generate as much data as we want and where we specify what the true underlying parameter values </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="64163">should be.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="64173">Sometimes it is easier to use sampling to approximate a statistical calculation, such as the calculation of an expectation value, rather than try to calculate the expectation value exactly using rigorous mathematics. </st><st c="64391">Sometimes, we may be dealing with complex data generation processes for which exact mathematical evaluation of a mean is just not possible, but it is possible to sample from the data generation process. </st><st c="64594">In these situations, we can generate large numbers of samples and use a simple numerical average to give us a very accurate approximation of the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="64739">population mean.</st></span></li>
