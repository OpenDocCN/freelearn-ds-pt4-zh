    Experienced data scientists may want to skip this short introduction, but you’ll
    soon get to the meat of the book and explore the many and varied ways ML with
    Python can be applied to the domain of business decisions through real-world business
    problems that you can tackle by yourself. As you advance, you’ll gain practical
    insights into the value that ML can provide to your business, as well as the technical
    ability to apply a wide variety of tried-and-tested ML methods.
