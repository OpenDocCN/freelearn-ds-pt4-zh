<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.1">With a background in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker561"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.1">econometry, Agustina had previous experience as an econometric modeler and decided to follow her passion early on in her career, even if it meant having a reduction in pay. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.2">Her other passions are coaching and photography. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.3">She worked on several projects, creating insights for top FMCG companies, and leading the teams that would create insights on topics such as brand equity, media ROI, assortment, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.4">One of her main focuses has been to understand the client’s needs in depth to achieve the objectives of business revenue </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.722.1">and EBITA.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.723.1">After working for several client accounts, she joined a top cosmetic company as head of Global Data Analytics and was tasked with building the data team for this company, to deliver data-driven solutions and create a cultural change in the organization to be more focused </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.1">on data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.1">Her leadership strategy can be regarded as setting in the table of discussion all the different stakeholders of a data team, regardless of their domain and backgrounds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.2">She fosters communication within the team without imposing a specific view, rather than working to get to know the client’s requirements to focus on the task to deliver, making sure that the team has all the resources to continue while focusing on improving </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.1">this communication.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.727.1">The vision she has of a data team is that it is a team in charge of changing realities and that companies can improve their operations by understanding that creating a data-driven culture is</span><a id="_idIndexMarker562"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.1"> necessary to improve skills and have a top-down approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.2">Most of the time, this requires a team that gets to be attached to the current organization and pushes these changes through a lot of work, and focuses on changing behaviors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.3">For Agustina, the eruption of data in companies can be seen as a technology that will drive any kind of change, magically solving and improving all metrics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.4">The data strategy sits on top of the current strategy to be able to increase the reach of the knowledge that we can use to make </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.1">better decisions.</span></span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.1">There are several types of approaches to achieving an effective transformation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.2">The creation of lighthouse groups, which are aspirational teams, examples of the transformation that they want to achieve, to guide the transformation is not enough because later, these teams collide with a reality different from the conditions in which they work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.3">This is because these teams have more resources than the others, and it differs from the real situation in which the rest of the company </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.733.1">finds itself.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.1">The Lighthouse model is opposed to the one set up by a parallel organization, which is in charge of transforming the company’s processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.2">It strongly implements them by establishing transformation objectives and clear incentives such as variable bonuses in the middle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.3">This generates internal conflicts but is maintained for the time that a new culture lasts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.4">This also implies that resources are required and that this transformation hurts as if it were </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.735.1">organizational adolescence.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.1">Some organizations have large margins that allow them to duplicate resources by creating transformation teams for each of the departments, which then end up joining those teams and departments that are seeking to improve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.2">The problem with this is that it duplicates resources but not all the equipment in those resources to carry out </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.737.1">this transformation.</span></span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.740.1">Middle management is the hardest to convince because by adopting a new strategy, they end up doing two things at once. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.740.2">While there are middle managers excited</span><a id="_idIndexMarker563"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.1"> about change, everything is defined with hands and resources, and carrying out the transformation requires diverting change processes and diverting resources from operations, which affects the performance metrics by which these middle managers are judged. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.2">Implementing an effective data strategy collides with reality when those who should be using the data do not change their processes to incorporate these metrics or insights into their decision-making and daily operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.3">These individuals are middle managers who are closer to operations and do not have the time or the skills to lead the transformation or drive the use </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.742.1">of data.</span></span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.1">The data is nothing if the processes are not changed; if you do not think about equipment and processes, the data that’s collected will not have a use or an impact. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.2">Data-driven does not have fewer resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.3">This is a misconception that arises from the spirit of IT, which always seeks to improve its operating costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.4">The data-driven strategy must focus on what generates revenue in the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.5">The CDO, who depends on IT or operations, aims to save costs and that does not work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.6">Data is neither less cost nor less time – it involves finding value opportunities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.7">An example is that of promotions or price reductions, which, if applied without sufficient data on customers and products, generate that subsidy for those who were already about to buy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.8">If we used data, we could calculate promotion elasticities and customize them to give each of the buyer segments what they want most by making them buy more than they would have but not generating trade spend savings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.9">Once the organization matures and understands the true role of the data strategy, that data strategy becomes the responsibility of either the sales department, the strategy department, or the general manager. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.10">Alternatively, you will need to do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.1">a C-level.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.1">In the case of people, it is important to think about the skills and abilities of each of them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.2">Some people are good at analysis, some people are good at bringing strategies to reality, and there are a few who do both things well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.3">Typically, data teams have strategy development capabilities and domain knowledge to carry out the data strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.4">This is because hard knowledge is not enough and data is complementary to a reality that needs to be known, so there is a need to have field knowledge to complement the use of data to make effective decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.5">This field knowledge lives in these middle ranks close to operations, who must learn from the data scientists doing the parts of the team with a CDO that coordinates these developments throughout all the teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.6">This does not work if there is a single centralized department that provides data to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.1">entire organization.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.762.1">In the case of technology, this is an enabler that allows the strategy to be carried out, but this technology is built on the data strategy, which, in turn, is built on a commercial strategy, not the other way around. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.762.2">Solutions of minimum</span><a id="_idIndexMarker565"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.763.1"> complexity should always be sought to solve a data problem that solves a business problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.763.2">This is carried out with a team of data engineers, MLOps, DataOps, and others, always controlling the quality of the development to ensure the reliability of information and the rules and abilities </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.764.1">of systems.</span></span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.1">Yes, well, I am a lifelong learner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.2">So, of course, I did some stuff myself but also spent a lot of time with our developers and analysts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.3">I spend a lot of time just sitting next to them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.4">So, it is always good to be multidisciplinary; then, you can see the value of working with other professionals from different domains. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.5">Often, this involves asking a lot of questions, looking from different perspectives, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.6">So, yes, that is where I started. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.7">We also did a lot of stuff surrounding media, the benefit of which is that media companies are always focused on how we can engage our customers and our consumers increasingly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.8">The latest features, functionality, and products are also presented here because everybody knows that they are incredibly open to new stuff. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.9">They generate a lot of data in terms of behavior, what they like, what they do not like, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.10">You can use this information to be able to produce a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker567"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.776.1">proper strategy.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.777.1">Which kind of methodologies do you use to uncover value in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.778.1">the data?</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.1">We have an approach that is moving toward a methodology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.2">But in my experience, most of the time, everybody has the same examples. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.3">And they do not take everything important to be successful in that area into account and forget to dive into the whole story. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.4">And then it is not only about collecting all kinds of data and then getting better because of it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.5">It is just to see and understand how they do it – more than what they do because you know that can differ. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.6">And what we like about our approach is that we make it small, and quite simple. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.7">We use data to tell us what is happening, and then we see what we can do, and everybody says data-driven or data decision-making or whatever. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.8">But it is much more on the human aspect and creativity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.9">And if you also look at the most, you know, data-driven companies, of course, they use data, but it is also still about creativity, intuition, and betting while being very honest. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.10">I have seen too many companies that hire a lot of data engineers, data and data scientists, and more while spending a lot of money on infrastructure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.11">We use data to see if our bet is right and if we are moving the needle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.12">We use a lot of it, and without customers, we work a lot on data sprints, also to make </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.1">it focused.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.1">We follow the journey of a customer, from beginning to end. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.2">All of this is possible, yet everybody’s busy with so much stuff, so we try to make it simple. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.3">That’s why we do a lot of stuff in data sprints for a couple of weeks – nobody tells you that a lot of times, to use data and get value from data, you don’t need a lot </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.1">of people.</span></span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.1">One of the challenges</span><a id="_idIndexMarker568"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.1"> is that companies that hire too many people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.2">I experienced this myself; I asked a data manager who is responsible for customer insights to say we need a churn prediction model, and then a couple of weeks later, or months, we ask how it is going. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.3">They say that it’s not clear what the business requirements are, but that we can do facial recognition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.4">However, that is not what we asked for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.5">We can build a recommendation engine, but we already have a recommendation, so this is not where we need it now. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.6">So, it is not our biggest issue to have more people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.7">There are a lot of companies with so many people working on a topic that it’s not beneficial or actionable, and we do not get real value from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.1">it either.</span></span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.1">What we are doing is trying to make it exceedingly small. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.2">So, start with a number. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.3">Say, for example, we are going to work data-driven. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.4">Okay; what is the answer? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.5">What is our first assumption? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.6">Let us see what we are, what we are discovering, and what we are experiencing – this 90 percent is data cleaning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.7">We are structuring data and getting the right labels, the right data, and the right definitions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.8">But nobody talks about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.9">So, we might try to make it simple, and then really get real about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.10">This concept of data sprints is a view of the landscape of where we work on it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.11">Is it sometimes very fragmented; for example, or it is a monolithic system or a landscape? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.12">Then, we ask, what is the business? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.13">What are we promising to the customer? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.14">How are we earning our money? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.15">Then, we try to get a view of the end-to-end journey of a customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.16">We start from here. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.17">What are our main challenges? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.18">What is the key question? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.19">Is it growth? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.20">Is it churn? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.21">Is it process automation? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.22">This is also related to the decision. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.23">Do we want to automate all kinds of stuff? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.24">Then, we must start with the hypothesis and work from there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.25">We must always try to get some value out of it in 6 weeks – 6 weeks only. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.26">We evaluate the infrastructure and the business model, and we look at the channels in the customer’s journey. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.27">Then, we must set ourselves a goal based on those 6 weeks, with a small team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.28">This team should be multidisciplinary and part of the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.29">It is your team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.30">Well, of course, we do it for the customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.31">And it is always, of course, a hybrid </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.791.1">multi-disciplinary team.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.1">The focus of the team depends, of course, on the top management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.2">If it is concerned with digital process automation, the objectives will be of a certain kind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.3">If it is a factory, for example, or an e-commerce company, it will focus on conversion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.4">It is, of course, a little bit of a different question when it comes to experience or where the focus is, depending on the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.5">So, that sometimes changes a little bit, but we always assist and work with the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.6">We use main and we have our data platform also, so it is our customers are difficult with five legacy systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.7">Then, we have our data platform, where we do the landscape analysis on the data in certain systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.8">Then, we can say, “give us the elements from this system so that we can create some sort of initial view.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.9">We use a lot of the global stack as well as some tooling, such as scripting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.10">There are also experts on that platform. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.11">However, our data platform is used to ensure that we </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.1">can accelerate.</span></span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.1">So, on average, I think that if you talk about data-driven, you should talk much more to your customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.2">Then, you should talk about what you see in the data, as well as what everyone else sees. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.3">After, you should talk about your revenue, costs, and the results you wish to obtain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.4">In the end, a lot of companies are only talking about those components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.5">If you are data-driven, then you can already predict what your result will be because you already see it in the behavior of customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.6">You will see what the outcome will be somewhere further along the line than the next quarter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.7">I think that, in the end, you will </span><a id="_idIndexMarker570"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.800.1">always end up committing to delivering on your promise, which is important to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.801.1">your customers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.802.1">Transforming companies into data-driven organizations requires a profound cultural change that needs to be implemented with a top-down approach, championed by leaders who can create a narrative to support the data strategy and adapt to the needs and objectives of the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.802.2">This transformation is not just about technology, but mostly about people and processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.802.3">I am thankful for the perspective of both Agustina and Patrick and hope that their experienc</span><a id="_idTextAnchor1522"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.803.1">es can help you create effective </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.1">cultural transformations.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.806.1">In this chapter, we explored the distinct parts that constitute a data transformation for companies that want to become data-driven by leveraging the perspective and experience of data leaders with extensive knowledge and experience in leading digital and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.807.1">data transformations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.808.1">These approaches allow not only companies to transform but also leaders and managers to adapt to the new skills and processes required to implement a successful data strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.808.2">By doing so, they have a clear goal of how the company will benefit from these efforts, how to create and lead data teams, as well as how to consider the implications of enabling digital and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.809.1">data transformation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.1">Overall, the objective of this book has been to help business leaders, managers, and enthusiasts implement ready-to-use recipes that seek to undercover insights about consumers, their behavior patterns, how they perceive prices, how they effectively make recommendations, and, in general, how to complement the commercial strategy with managerial economics applied </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.811.1">in Python.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.1">I have leveraged the knowledge of coders, managers, and specialists from whom I got the inspiration to author this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.2">All the code and data that’s been modified and used in this book belong to their respective owners and producers, to whom I am grateful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.3">Most of all, I want to thank the data leaders, who, amid their incredibly busy day-to-day lives, have taken the time to answer the questions presented in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.813.1">this chapter.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.814.1">I am thankful for the time you took to read this book, and hopefully, it has inspired you to use data and achieve your objectives while having fun and enjoying </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.815.1">the process.</span></span></p>
