    data. As such, it is often easier to base decisions on assumptions and intuition.
    The last conversation they had with a customer, for example, can oversteer many
    decisions. Creating a culture where the default is to turn to a deeper analysis
    of data in decision-making requires that there be a strong focus on making the
    necessary data available, easily understandable, and trustworthy. These require
    large investments that many companies are not willing to make.

    has focused more on the production side of businesses, and this could yield even
    bigger returns – helping pharmaceutical companies speed up drug discovery, helping
    agricultural companies to improve crop yield, and helping chemical companies to
    produce novel new compounds faster. Using data to reduce long, expensive investments

    Here, the data team can provide data services to the business and help them to
    increase their focus, or not. If they do, they become an operative service of
    the firm with no life on its own. However, as data teams are new and thus finding
    their identity within the firm as well, placing themselves as “data operatives”
    or “data providers” is not what they want. If they accept themselves as “data
    servers,” I think it optimal that the business takes the time to explain the problems
    and the pains until they are truly clear, and the data team must bring specific
    solutions for these pain points. No more, no less.

    current organization and pushes these changes through a lot of work, and focuses
    on changing behaviors. For Agustina, the eruption of data in companies can be
    seen as a technology that will drive any kind of change, magically solving and
    improving all metrics. The data strategy sits on top of the current strategy to
    be able to increase the reach of the knowledge that we can use to make better

  prefs:

    The creation of lighthouse groups, which are aspirational teams, examples of the
    transformation that they want to achieve, to guide the transformation is not enough
    because later, these teams collide with a reality different from the conditions
    in which they work. This is because these teams have more resources than the others,
    and it differs from the real situation in which the rest of the company finds
    itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Lighthouse model is opposed to the one set up by a parallel organization,
    which is in charge of transforming the company’s processes. It strongly implements
    them by establishing transformation objectives and clear incentives such as variable
    bonuses in the middle. This generates internal conflicts but is maintained for
    the time that a new culture lasts. This also implies that resources are required
    and that this transformation hurts as if it were organizational adolescence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some organizations have large margins that allow them to duplicate resources
    by creating transformation teams for each of the departments, which then end up
    joining those teams and departments that are seeking to improve. The problem with
    this is that it duplicates resources but not all the equipment in those resources
    to carry out this transformation.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Middle management is the hardest to convince because by adopting a new strategy,
    they end up doing two things at once. While there are middle managers excited
    about change, everything is defined with hands and resources, and carrying out
    the transformation requires diverting change processes and diverting resources
    from operations, which affects the performance metrics by which these middle managers
    are judged. Implementing an effective data strategy collides with reality when
    those who should be using the data do not change their processes to incorporate
    these metrics or insights into their decision-making and daily operations. These
    individuals are middle managers who are closer to operations and do not have the
    time or the skills to lead the transformation or drive the use of data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data is nothing if the processes are not changed; if you do not think about
    equipment and processes, the data that’s collected will not have a use or an impact.
    Data-driven does not have fewer resources. This is a misconception that arises
    from the spirit of IT, which always seeks to improve its operating costs. The
    data-driven strategy must focus on what generates revenue in the company. The
    CDO, who depends on IT or operations, aims to save costs and that does not work.
    Data is neither less cost nor less time – it involves finding value opportunities.
    An example is that of promotions or price reductions, which, if applied without
    sufficient data on customers and products, generate that subsidy for those who
    were already about to buy. If we used data, we could calculate promotion elasticities
    and customize them to give each of the buyer segments what they want most by making
    them buy more than they would have but not generating trade spend savings. Once
    the organization matures and understands the true role of the data strategy, that
    data strategy becomes the responsibility of either the sales department, the strategy
    department, or the general manager. Alternatively, you will need to do a C-level.

    of each of them. Some people are good at analysis, some people are good at bringing
    strategies to reality, and there are a few who do both things well. Typically,
    data teams have strategy development capabilities and domain knowledge to carry
    out the data strategy. This is because hard knowledge is not enough and data is
    complementary to a reality that needs to be known, so there is a need to have
    field knowledge to complement the use of data to make effective decisions. This
    field knowledge lives in these middle ranks close to operations, who must learn
    from the data scientists doing the parts of the team with a CDO that coordinates
    these developments throughout all the teams. This does not work if there is a
    single centralized department that provides data to the entire organization.

    most of the time, everybody has the same examples. And they do not take everything
    important to be successful in that area into account and forget to dive into the
    whole story. And then it is not only about collecting all kinds of data and then
    getting better because of it. It is just to see and understand how they do it
    – more than what they do because you know that can differ. And what we like about
    our approach is that we make it small, and quite simple. We use data to tell us
    what is happening, and then we see what we can do, and everybody says data-driven
    or data decision-making or whatever. But it is much more on the human aspect and
    creativity. And if you also look at the most, you know, data-driven companies,
    of course, they use data, but it is also still about creativity, intuition, and
    betting while being very honest. I have seen too many companies that hire a lot
    of data engineers, data and data scientists, and more while spending a lot of
    money on infrastructure. We use data to see if our bet is right and if we are

    we ask how it is going. They say that it’s not clear what the business requirements
    are, but that we can do facial recognition. However, that is not what we asked
    for. We can build a recommendation engine, but we already have a recommendation,
    so this is not where we need it now. So, it is not our biggest issue to have more
    people. There are a lot of companies with so many people working on a topic that
    it’s not beneficial or actionable, and we do not get real value from it either.

    Say, for example, we are going to work data-driven. Okay; what is the answer?
    What is our first assumption? Let us see what we are, what we are discovering,
    and what we are experiencing – this 90 percent is data cleaning. We are structuring
    data and getting the right labels, the right data, and the right definitions.
    But nobody talks about it. So, we might try to make it simple, and then really
    get real about it. This concept of data sprints is a view of the landscape of
    where we work on it. Is it sometimes very fragmented; for example, or it is a
    monolithic system or a landscape? Then, we ask, what is the business? What are
    we promising to the customer? How are we earning our money? Then, we try to get
    a view of the end-to-end journey of a customer. We start from here. What are our
    main challenges? What is the key question? Is it growth? Is it churn? Is it process
    automation? This is also related to the decision. Do we want to automate all kinds
    of stuff? Then, we must start with the hypothesis and work from there. We must
    always try to get some value out of it in 6 weeks – 6 weeks only. We evaluate
    the infrastructure and the business model, and we look at the channels in the
    customer’s journey. Then, we must set ourselves a goal based on those 6 weeks,
    with a small team. This team should be multidisciplinary and part of the company.
    It is your team. Well, of course, we do it for the customers. And it is always,
    of course, a hybrid multi-disciplinary team.

    It is, of course, a little bit of a different question when it comes to experience
    or where the focus is, depending on the company. So, that sometimes changes a
    little bit, but we always assist and work with the customer. We use main and we
    have our data platform also, so it is our customers are difficult with five legacy
    systems. Then, we have our data platform, where we do the landscape analysis on
    the data in certain systems. Then, we can say, “give us the elements from this
    system so that we can create some sort of initial view.” We use a lot of the global
    stack as well as some tooling, such as scripting. There are also experts on that
    platform. However, our data platform is used to ensure that we can accelerate.

    as well as what everyone else sees. After, you should talk about your revenue,
    costs, and the results you wish to obtain. In the end, a lot of companies are
    only talking about those components. If you are data-driven, then you can already
    predict what your result will be because you already see it in the behavior of
    customers. You will see what the outcome will be somewhere further along the line
    than the next quarter. I think that, in the end, you will always end up committing
