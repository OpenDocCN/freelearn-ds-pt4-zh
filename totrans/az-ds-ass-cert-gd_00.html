			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>This book helps you acquire practical knowledge about machine learning experimentation on Azure. It covers everything you need to know and understand to become a certified Azure Data Scientist Associate. </p>
			<p>The book starts with an introduction to data science, making sure you are familiar with the terminology used throughout the book. You then move into the <strong class="bold">Azure Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">AzureML</strong>) workspace, your working area for the rest of the book. You will discover the studio interface and manage the various components, like the data stores and the compute clusters. </p>
			<p>You will then focus on no-code, and low-code experimentation. You will discover the Automated ML wizard, which helps you to locate and deploy optimal models for your dataset. You will also learn how to run end-to-end data science experiments using the designer provided in AzureML studio.</p>
			<p>You will then deep dive into the code first data science experimentation. You will explore the <strong class="bold">AzureML Software Development Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDK</strong>) for Python and learn how to create experiments and publish models using code. You will learn how to use powerful computer clusters to scale up and out your machine learning jobs. You will learn how to optimize your model’s hyperparameters using Hyperdrive. Then you will learn how to use responsible AI tools to interpret and debug your models. Once you have a trained model, you will learn to operationalize it for batch or real-time inferences and how you can monitor it in production.</p>
			<p>With this knowledge, you will have a good understanding of the Azure Machine Learning platform and you will be able to clear the DP100 exam with flying colors.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>The book targets two audiences: developers who seek to infuse their applications with AI capabilities and data scientists who want to scale their ML experiments in the Azure cloud. Basic knowledge of Python is needed to follow the code samples present in the book. Some experience in training ML models in Python with common frameworks such as scikit-learn will help you understand the content more easily.</p>

			<p>In this book, we guide you to use the Notebooks experience available within the AzureML studio. If you want to execute the same code on your workstation instead of the cloud-based experience, you will need a Python environment to run Jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to run Jupyter notebooks on your workstation is through VSCode, a free cross-platform editor with fantastic Python support. You will also need to install Git in your workstation to clone the book’s GitHub repository.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book's GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.</strong></p>
			<p>If you face any issue executing the code, ensure that you have cloned the latest version from the GitHub repository. If the problem persists, feel free to open a GitHub issue to describe the issue you are facing and help you solve it. </p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Code in text</strong>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "You can also change the autogenerated name of the pipeline you are designing. Rename the current pipeline to <strong class="source-inline">test-pipeline</strong>."</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">from azureml.train.hyperdrive import GridParameterSampling</p>
			<p class="source-code">from azureml.train.hyperdrive import choice</p>
			<p class="source-code">param_sampling = GridParameterSampling( {</p>
			<p class="source-code">        "a": choice(0.01, 0.5),</p>
			<p class="source-code">        "b": choice(10, 100)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    }</p>
			<p class="source-code">)</p>
			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
			<p class="source-code">from azureml.core import Workspace</p>
			<p class="source-code">ws = Workspace.from_config()</p>
			<p class="source-code">loans_ds = ws.datasets['<strong class="bold">loans</strong>']</p>
			<p class="source-code">compute_target = ws.compute_targets['<strong class="bold">cpu-sm-cluster</strong>']</p>
			<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">az group create --name my-name-rg --location westeurope</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: "Navigate to the <strong class="bold">Author</strong> | <strong class="bold">Notebooks</strong> section of your AzureML Studio web interface."</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips or important notes	</p>
			<p class="callout">Run numbers may be different in your executions. Every time you execute the cells, a new run number is created, continuing from the previous number. So, if you execute code that performs one hyperdrive run with 20 child runs, the last child run will be run 21. The next time you execute the same code, the hyperdrive run will start from run 22, and the last child will be run 42. The run numbers referred to in this section are the ones shown in the various figures, and it is normal to observe differences, especially if you had to rerun a couple of cells.</p>
