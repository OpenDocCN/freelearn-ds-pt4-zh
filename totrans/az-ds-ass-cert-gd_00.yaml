- en: This book helps you acquire practical knowledge about machine learning experimentation
    on Azure. It covers everything you need to know and understand to become a certified
    Azure Data Scientist Associate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts with an introduction to data science, making sure you are familiar
    with the terminology used throughout the book. You then move into the **Azure
    Machine Learning** (**AzureML**) workspace, your working area for the rest of
    the book. You will discover the studio interface and manage the various components,
    like the data stores and the compute clusters.

- en: You will then focus on no-code, and low-code experimentation. You will discover
    the Automated ML wizard, which helps you to locate and deploy optimal models for
    your dataset. You will also learn how to run end-to-end data science experiments
    using the designer provided in AzureML studio.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will then deep dive into the code first data science experimentation. You
    will explore the **AzureML Software Development Kit** (**SDK**) for Python and
    learn how to create experiments and publish models using code. You will learn
    how to use powerful computer clusters to scale up and out your machine learning
    jobs. You will learn how to optimize your model’s hyperparameters using Hyperdrive.
    Then you will learn how to use responsible AI tools to interpret and debug your
    models. Once you have a trained model, you will learn to operationalize it for
    batch or real-time inferences and how you can monitor it in production.

    Learning platform and you will be able to clear the DP100 exam with flying colors.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The book targets two audiences: developers who seek to infuse their applications
    with AI capabilities and data scientists who want to scale their ML experiments
    in the Azure cloud. Basic knowledge of Python is needed to follow the code samples
    present in the book. Some experience in training ML models in Python with common
    frameworks such as scikit-learn will help you understand the content more easily.'

    the AzureML studio. If you want to execute the same code on your workstation instead
    of the cloud-based experience, you will need a Python environment to run Jupyter
    notebooks. The easiest way to run Jupyter notebooks on your workstation is through
    VSCode, a free cross-platform editor with fantastic Python support. You will also
    need to install Git in your workstation to clone the book’s GitHub repository.

    cells, a new run number is created, continuing from the previous number. So, if
    you execute code that performs one hyperdrive run with 20 child runs, the last
    child run will be run 21\. The next time you execute the same code, the hyperdrive
    run will start from run 22, and the last child will be run 42\. The run numbers
    referred to in this section are the ones shown in the various figures, and it
    is normal to observe differences, especially if you had to rerun a couple of cells.
