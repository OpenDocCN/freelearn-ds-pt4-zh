			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Chapter 3</em>: Azure Machine Learning Studio Components</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you will explore the <strong class="bold">Azure Machine Learning Studio</strong> (<strong class="bold">Azure ML Studio</strong>) web interface, an immersive experience for managing the end-to-end machine learning life cycle. You will get an overview of the available components that allow you to manage your workspace resources, author machine learning models, and track your assets, including your datasets, trained models, and their published endpoints.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Interacting with the Azure ML resource</li>
				<li>Exploring the Azure ML Studio experience</li>
				<li>Authoring experiments within Azure ML Studio</li>
				<li>Tracking data science assets in Azure ML Studio</li>
				<li>Managing infrastructure resources in Azure ML Studio</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>You will need to have access to an Azure subscription. Within that subscription, you will need a <strong class="bold">resource group</strong> named <strong class="source-inline">packt-azureml-rg</strong>. You will need to have either a <strong class="source-inline">Contributor</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">Owner</strong> <strong class="bold">access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) role at the resource group level. Within that resource group, you should deploy a <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> resource named <strong class="source-inline">packt-learning-mlw</strong>. These resources should already be available to you if you followed the instructions in <a href="B16777_02_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Azure Machine Learning Workspace Resources</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Interacting with the Azure ML resource</h1>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> previous chapter, you deployed the <strong class="source-inline">packt-learning-mlw</strong> machine learning resource within the <strong class="source-inline">packt-azureml-rg</strong> resource group. Navigate to the deployed resource by typing in its name in the top search bar and selecting the resource from the results list:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Navigating to the Azure Machine Learning resource</p>
			<p>This will land you on the overview pane of the resource, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.2</em>: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>On the left-hand side, you will see the typical resource menu that most of the Azure services have. This menu is also referred to as the left pane.</li>
				<li>At the top, you will see the command bar, which allows you to download the <strong class="source-inline">config.json</strong> file, a file that contains all the information you need to connect to the workspace through the Python SDK, and to delete the machine learning workspace.</li>
				<li>Below the command bar, you can see the working pane, which is where you can view information related to the workspace, including links to the storage account, key vault, container registry, and application insights resources that got deployed with this workspace:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer048" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B16777_03_002.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – The machine learning resource page&#13;&#10;" width="1171" height="1142"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – The machine learning resource page</p>
			<p>On the left <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>pane, you will find all the common options you can find in all Azure resources. This includes the following indicative list:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="screen-inline">Access control (IAM)</strong>, which you can use to configure role access to the specific workspace, including assigning custom roles such as the ones you created in the previous chapter.</li>
				<li><strong class="screen-inline">Diagnostic settings</strong>, which enables you to configure streaming exports for the logs and metrics generated by the Azure Machine Learning workspace to the destination of your <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>choice. Typically, this is <strong class="bold">Log Analytics</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> is part of <strong class="bold">Azure Monitor</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="screen-inline">New support request</strong>, which allows you to easily request support if you ever face an issue with your workspace.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the <strong class="screen-inline">Settings</strong> section, you will also notice the <strong class="screen-inline">Private endpoint connections</strong> option, which allows you to configure an Azure Private Endpoint. This is a virtual network interface that you can attach to a virtual network. It allows all the resources within that virtual network to connect to your Azure Machine Learning workspace privately and securely. Once you enable this option, all data plane operations, such as using Azure ML Studio, APIs (including published pipelines), or the <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>SDK will need to go through this private endpoint.</p>
			<p>Select the overview option from the left pane and click on the <strong class="screen-inline">Launch studio</strong> button in the middle of the working pane. This will open a new tab in your browser, which will lead you to the Studio experience.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Exploring the Azure ML Studio experience</h1>
			<p>Azure Machine<a id="_idIndexMarker202"/> Learning comes with a dedicated web interface that allows you to implement both no-code and code-first data science initiatives. You can access the web interface either through the <strong class="screen-inline">Launch studio</strong> button within the Azure portal resource, as you saw in the previous section, or by visiting the <a href="https://ml.azure.com">https://ml.azure.com</a> page directly. With the latter approach, if this is your first time you've<a id="_idIndexMarker203"/> visited the Studio site, you will have to manually select the <strong class="bold">Azure Active Directory</strong> tenant, the <strong class="bold">Subscription</strong>, and the name of <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>the <strong class="bold">Machine Learning workspace</strong> you want to connect to, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.3</em>.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – Selecting the machine learning workspace in ml.azure.com</p>
			<p>Once you've<a id="_idIndexMarker205"/> selected your workspace, you will land on the home page of Azure Machine Learning Studio, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.4</em>.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer050" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – Azure Machine Learning Studio home page</p>
			<p>On the left-hand<a id="_idIndexMarker206"/> side, you have a menu that provides the following categories, all of which you will explore in the upcoming sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Author</strong>: Build, train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models using the authoring tools.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assets</strong>: Prepare your data, run and monitor your jobs, view and deploy models, and manage real-time and pipeline endpoints.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manage</strong>: View and manage resources for your workspace.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can collapse the menu by clicking on the top-left icon, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Collapsed side menu</p>
			<p>In the top-right <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>corner, as shown in the <em class="italic">Figure 3.6</em>, you have the following options:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Sign in info:</strong> This displays information about the logged-in user and allows you to sign out.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Workspace selector:</strong> This allows you to change the active Azure Machine Learning workspace you are working on.</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – Top-right menu</p>
			<p>In the next<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> section, we'll look at the various sections of the left menu, starting with the authoring ones. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Authoring experiments within Azure ML Studio</h1>
			<p>Azure ML <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>Studio provides the following authoring experiences:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Notebooks</strong> allows you to work with <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>files, folders, and <strong class="bold">Jupyter Notebooks</strong> directly in the workspace. You will be working with notebooks in <a href="B16777_07_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">The AzureML Python SDK</em>, where you will see the code-first data science process.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automated ML</strong> allows you to rapidly test multiple combinations of algorithms against a given dataset and find the best model based on the success metric you define. You will read more about this in <a href="B16777_05_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Letting the Machines Do the Model Training</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Designer</strong> allows you to visually design an experiment by connecting datasets and modules such as data transformation and model training in a flow. By designing this flow on a canvas, you can train and deploy machine learning models without writing any code, something that you will read more about in <a href="B16777_06_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Visual Model Training and Publishing</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data Labeling</strong> allows you to create labeling projects for curating datasets. This allows you to scale out your labeling efforts to multiple labelers, efficiently coordinate the labeling efforts, and augment the labelers' productivity using ML Assist, which automatically trains while you label data.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Both automated ML and designer are part of the no-code/low code approaches to data science, something you will explore later in this book.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note </p>
			<p class="callout">Data labeling is currently under the <strong class="bold">Manage </strong>section, from the left menu. Nevertheless, it is logically part <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>of the authoring experience that Azure ML Studio provides. Since the Studio experience is constantly evolving, this feature may move under the <strong class="bold">Author </strong>section in the near future.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Tracking data science assets in Azure ML Studio</h1>
			<p>Within the <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>assets section, you can track all the<a id="_idIndexMarker213"/> components that are at the heart of machine learning operations. Every data science project has the following assets:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Datasets</strong> is where you can find registered datasets. This is a centralized registry where you can register your datasets and avoid colleagues having to work on local copies of the same data or, even worse, subsets of this data. You will work with datasets in <a href="B16777_04_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring the Workspace</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Experiments</strong> is a centralized place to track groups of script executions or runs. When you are training a model, you are logging various aspects of that process, including metrics that you might need to compare performance. To group all attempts under the same context, you should submit all the runs under the same experiment name; then, the results will appear in this area. You will work with experiments in <a href="B16777_05_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Letting the Machines Do the Model Training</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pipelines</strong> allows you to create and manage workflows that orchestrate machine learning steps. For example, a very common machine learning training workflow contains three steps: data processing, model training, and model registration. Pipelines can be either ML training ones, like the ones shown in the previous example, or batch data inferencing ones – in other words, pipelines that use a machine learning model to make inferences for a dataset. In this section, you can view all registered pipelines, monitor their executions, and see the published endpoints, which allow you to trigger one of those pipelines ad hoc. You will be working with pipelines in <a href="B16777_11_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Pipelines</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Models</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>registry for your <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>machine learning models. It's where you keep track of their versions. It allows you to instantly deploy through the web interface. To publish a model, you will need to register it first in this registry. You will be working with this registry throughout this book, starting from <a href="B16777_05_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Letting the Machines Do the Model Training</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Endpoints</strong> consists of two parts: the real-time endpoints and the pipeline endpoints. Real-time<a id="_idIndexMarker216"/> endpoints are web applications<a id="_idIndexMarker217"/> hosted either in <strong class="bold">Azure Container Instances</strong> (<strong class="bold">ACI</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Azure Kubernetes Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AKS</strong>), and they expose a REST API, which allows third-party applications to consume the machine learning model you have deployed. Pipeline endpoints, on the other hand, are the endpoints that allow you to trigger pipelines that have been registered in the corresponding sections mentioned previously.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All the preceding experiences are interconnected, and you will find yourself navigating from one section to the other while you are exploring the experiments you will be conducting:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – Interconnected assets in Azure ML</p>
			<p>A prerequisite <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>for running a machine learning<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> experiment is to have computational resources that will execute the training scripts. You will also need engines that will store, and give access to, the data that you register as datasets. These are the resources you will manage in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Managing infrastructure resources in Azure ML Studio</h1>
			<p>To conduct <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>an experiment, you will need a couple of infrastructure resources to consume. You can configure and manage them through the following sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Compute</strong> provides the managed compute infrastructure you can use in your experiments. This allows you to register and utilize virtual machines that may have multiple CPUs and GPUs and memory sizes that can load humongous datasets into them. Having those computes as a managed service means that you don't have to worry about installing the operating system or keeping it patched and up to date. You will learn more about the various compute options in <a href="B16777_04_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring the Workspace</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Datastores</strong> contains the connection information needed to get access to the data within <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>various <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>engines, such as <strong class="bold">Azure Blob Storage</strong> and <strong class="bold">Azure SQL Database</strong>. This<a id="_idIndexMarker223"/> information is used to access the datasets that you registered in the <strong class="bold">Compute</strong> section. You will learn more about the concepts surrounding datastores in <a href="B16777_04_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring the Workspace</em>. </li>
				<li>Linked services allow you to view the connections between external services and your workspace. For example, you can connect you Synapse Spark pools and run data preparation tasks with Spark.</li>
				<li>Environments allow you to specify the software requirements for your code to execute. For example, if you are training a PyTorch model, you will need the PyTorch library installed in the environment that will execute your training scripts. You will learn more about the environments in <a href="B16777_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor117"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Experimenting with Python Code</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Azure Machine Learning Studio provides a web environment where you can manage all the artifacts in your Azure Machine Learning workspace. You can view and manage your Jupyter notebooks, datasets, experiments, pipelines, models, and endpoints. You can also manage the compute resources and datastores that will be used in your experiments. Studio also offers interactive tools you can use to perform no-code data science experiments, something you will deep dive into in the next chapters of this book. The AutoML wizard is the first no-code experience that's baked into Azure ML Studio and allows you to run automated machine learning experiments. Azure Machine Learning designer is the next no-code experience and helps you graphically design pipelines and create workflows without writing code. This experience also enables low-code scenarios, where you can drop code snippets if needed. Finally, data labeling projects allow you to create, manage, and monitor tedious projects to label your data. </p>
			<p>To start using these interactive tools, you will need to provision, at the very least, a compute resource. Moreover, you will need to register your data stores. These data stores will host the data you will be using in the model training phase. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to perform these actions through Azure ML Studio.</p>
