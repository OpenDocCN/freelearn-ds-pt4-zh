    all the artifacts in your Azure Machine Learning workspace. You can view and manage
    your Jupyter notebooks, datasets, experiments, pipelines, models, and endpoints.
    You can also manage the compute resources and datastores that will be used in
    your experiments. Studio also offers interactive tools you can use to perform
    no-code data science experiments, something you will deep dive into in the next
    chapters of this book. The AutoML wizard is the first no-code experience that's
    baked into Azure ML Studio and allows you to run automated machine learning experiments.
    Azure Machine Learning designer is the next no-code experience and helps you graphically
    design pipelines and create workflows without writing code. This experience also
    enables low-code scenarios, where you can drop code snippets if needed. Finally,
    data labeling projects allow you to create, manage, and monitor tedious projects
    to label your data.
