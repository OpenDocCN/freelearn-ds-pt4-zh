- en: Azure Machine Learning Studio offers various no-code/low-code wizards and designers
    that enable power users to perform end-to-end data science experiments. Experienced
    data scientists and machine learning engineers also use these experiences to kick
    start a project, verify a hypothesis, understand which model performs best on
    a given dataset and design data cleansing processes without writing any code.
    In this section, you will learn how to run data science experiments through the
    web designers and wizards provided in Azure ML Studio.
