			<p>FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6 and its later versions based on standard Python type hints. With this book, you’ll be able to create fast and reliable data science API backends using <span class="No-Break">practical examples.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>This book starts with the basics of the FastAPI framework and associated modern Python programming concepts. You’ll then be taken through all the aspects of the framework, including its powerful dependency injection system and how you can use it to communicate with databases, implement authentication, and integrate machine learning models. Later, you will cover the best practices relating to testing and deployment to run a high-quality, robust application. You’ll also be introduced to the extensive ecosystem of Python data science packages. As you progress, you’ll learn how to build data science applications in Python using FastAPI. The book also demonstrates how to develop fast and efficient machine learning prediction backends. For this, you’ll be taken through two projects covering typical use cases of AI: real-time object detection and <span class="No-Break">text-to-image generation.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>By the end of this FastAPI book, you’ll have not only learned how to implement Python in data science projects but also how to maintain and design them to meet high programming standards with the help <span class="No-Break">of FastAPI.</span></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
			<p>This book is for data scientists and software developers interested in gaining knowledge of FastAPI and its ecosystem to build data science applications. Basic knowledge of data science and machine learning concepts and how to apply them in Python <span class="No-Break">is recommended.</span></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>What this book covers</h1>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Python Development Environment Setup</em>, is aimed at setting up the development environment so that you can start working with Python and FastAPI. We’ll introduce the various tools that are commonly used in the Python community to <span class="No-Break">ease development.</span></p>&#13;

			<p><a href="B19528_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor176"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Pydantic Data Models in FastAPI</em>, covers in more detail the definition of data models with Pydantic, the underlying data validation library used by FastAPI. We’ll explain how to implement variations of the same model without repeating ourselves, thanks to class inheritance. Finally, we’ll show how to implement custom data validation logic on <span class="No-Break">those models.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor285"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Dependency Injection in FastAPI</em>, explains how dependency injection works and how we can define our own dependencies to reuse logic across different routers <span class="No-Break">and endpoints.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor346"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Databases and Asynchronous ORMs</em>, demonstrates how we can set up a connection with a database to read and write data. We’ll cover how to use SQLAlchemy to work asynchronously with SQL databases and how they interact with the Pydantic model. Finally, we’ll also show you how to work with MongoDB, a <span class="No-Break">NoSQL database.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor448"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Authentication and Security in FastAPI</em>, shows us how to implement a basic authentication system to protect our API endpoints and return the relevant data for the authenticated user. We’ll also talk about the best practices around CORS and how to be safe from <span class="No-Break">CSRF attacks.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor551"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Defining WebSockets for Two-Way Interactive Communication in FastAPI</em>, is aimed at understanding WebSockets and how to create them and handle the messages received <span class="No-Break">with FastAPI.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor618"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Testing an API Asynchronously with pytest and HTTPX</em>, shows us how to write tests for our REST <span class="No-Break">API endpoints.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor694"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying a FastAPI Project</em>, covers the common configuration for running FastAPI applications smoothly in production. We’ll also explore several deployment options: PaaS platforms, Docker, and the traditional <span class="No-Break">server setup.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor797"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Data Science in Python</em>, gives a quick introduction to machine learning before moving on to two core libraries for data science in Python: NumPy and pandas. We’ll also show the basics of the scikit-learn library, a set of ready-to-use tools to perform machine learning tasks <span class="No-Break">in Python.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor960"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Creating an Efficient Prediction API Endpoint with FastAPI</em>, shows how we can efficiently store a trained machine learning model using Joblib. Then, we’ll integrate it into a FastAPI backend, considering some technical details of FastAPI internals to achieve maximum performance. Finally, we’ll show a way to cache results <span class="No-Break">using Joblib.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1005"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing a Real-Time Object Detection System Using Web</em><em class="italic">S</em><em class="italic">ockets with FastAPI</em>, implements a simple application to perform object detection in the browser, backed by a FastAPI WebSocket and a pre-trained computer vision model from the Hugging <span class="No-Break">Face library.</span></p>&#13;

Since this task is a resource-intensive, slow process, we’ll see how to create a distributed system using worker queues that’ll stand behind our FastAPI backend and will perform the computations in <span class="No-Break">the background.</span></p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B19528_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1054"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Monitoring the Health and Performance of a Data Science System</em>, covers the extra mile so you are able to build robust, production-ready systems. One of the most important aspects to achieve this is to have all the data we need to ensure the system is operating correctly and detect as soon as possible when something goes wrong so we can take corrective actions. In this chapter, we’ll see how to set up a proper logging facility and how we can monitor the performance and health of our software in <span class="No-Break">real time.</span></p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>&#13;
			<p>In this book, we’ll mainly work with the Python programming language. The first chapter will explain how to set up a proper Python environment on your operating system. Some examples also involve running web pages with JavaScript, so you’ll need a modern browser such as Google Chrome or <span class="No-Break">Mozilla Firefox.</span></p>&#13;
			<p>In <a href="B19528_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1041"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a>, we’ll run the Stable Diffusion model, which requires a powerful machine. We recommend a computer with 16 GB of RAM and a modern NVIDIA GPU to be able to generate <span class="No-Break">good-looking images.</span></p>&#13;
