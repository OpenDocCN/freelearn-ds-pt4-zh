- en: FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6 and its later versions
    based on standard Python type hints. With this book, you’ll be able to create
    fast and reliable data science API backends using practical examples.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This book starts with the basics of the FastAPI framework and associated modern
    Python programming concepts. You’ll then be taken through all the aspects of the
    framework, including its powerful dependency injection system and how you can
    use it to communicate with databases, implement authentication, and integrate
    machine learning models. Later, you will cover the best practices relating to
    testing and deployment to run a high-quality, robust application. You’ll also
    be introduced to the extensive ecosystem of Python data science packages. As you
    progress, you’ll learn how to build data science applications in Python using
    FastAPI. The book also demonstrates how to develop fast and efficient machine
    learning prediction backends. For this, you’ll be taken through two projects covering
    typical use cases of AI: real-time object detection and text-to-image generation.'

    Python in data science projects but also how to maintain and design them to meet
    high programming standards with the help of FastAPI.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B19528_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024), *Python Development Environment
    Setup*, is aimed at setting up the development environment so that you can start
    working with Python and FastAPI. We’ll introduce the various tools that are commonly
    used in the Python community to ease development.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B19528_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor032), *Python Programming Specificities*,
    introduces you to the specificities of programming in Python, specifically block
    indentation, control flow statements, exception handling, and the object-oriented
    paradigm. We’ll also cover features such as list comprehensions and generators.
    Finally, we’ll see how type hinting and asynchronous I/O work.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B19528_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058), *Developing a RESTful API
    with FastAPI*, covers the basics of the creation of a RESTful API with FastAPI:
    routing, parameters, request body validation, and response. We’ll also show how
    to properly structure a FastAPI project with dedicated modules and separate routers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B19528_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor176), *Managing Pydantic Data Models
    in FastAPI*, covers in more detail the definition of data models with Pydantic,
    the underlying data validation library used by FastAPI. We’ll explain how to implement
    variations of the same model without repeating ourselves, thanks to class inheritance.
    Finally, we’ll show how to implement custom data validation logic on those models.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B19528_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor285), *Dependency Injection in FastAPI*,
    explains how dependency injection works and how we can define our own dependencies
    to reuse logic across different routers and endpoints.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B19528_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor346), *Databases and Asynchronous
    ORMs*, demonstrates how we can set up a connection with a database to read and
    write data. We’ll cover how to use SQLAlchemy to work asynchronously with SQL
    databases and how they interact with the Pydantic model. Finally, we’ll also show
    you how to work with MongoDB, a NoSQL database.'

- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B19528_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor448), *Managing Authentication and
    Security in FastAPI*, shows us how to implement a basic authentication system
    to protect our API endpoints and return the relevant data for the authenticated
    user. We’ll also talk about the best practices around CORS and how to be safe
    from CSRF attacks.'

    in Python*, gives a quick introduction to machine learning before moving on to
    two core libraries for data science in Python: NumPy and pandas. We’ll also show
    the basics of the scikit-learn library, a set of ready-to-use tools to perform
    machine learning tasks in Python.'

    API Endpoint with FastAPI*, shows how we can efficiently store a trained machine
    learning model using Joblib. Then, we’ll integrate it into a FastAPI backend,
    considering some technical details of FastAPI internals to achieve maximum performance.

    able to generate images from text prompts using the popular Stable Diffusion model.
    Since this task is a resource-intensive, slow process, we’ll see how to create
    a distributed system using worker queues that’ll stand behind our FastAPI backend
    and will perform the computations in the background.'

    Performance of a Data Science System*, covers the extra mile so you are able to
    build robust, production-ready systems. One of the most important aspects to achieve
    this is to have all the data we need to ensure the system is operating correctly
    and detect as soon as possible when something goes wrong so we can take corrective
    actions. In this chapter, we’ll see how to set up a proper logging facility and
    how we can monitor the performance and health of our software in real time.'

    chapter will explain how to set up a proper Python environment on your operating
    system. Some examples also involve running web pages with JavaScript, so you’ll
    need a modern browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

    model, which requires a powerful machine. We recommend a computer with 16 GB of
    RAM and a modern NVIDIA GPU to be able to generate good-looking images.
