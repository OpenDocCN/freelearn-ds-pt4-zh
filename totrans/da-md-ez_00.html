			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="Introduction-Title--PACKT-"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
			<p class="normal">Data analytics is a sexy topic these days. Skills such as machine learning, data visualization, and storytelling are becoming essential in virtually any professional field. The necessity to acquire data fluency is not a thing for data scientists and analysts only: it is becoming a development objective for pretty much everyone, irrespectively of their education, experience, business function, and seniority level. It is a universal need.</p>
			<p class="normal">For the majority of people interested in using analytics, learning how to code in a programming language is an intimidating barrier to break and—sadly—the first reason for abandoning their intent. For this reason, this book leverages low-code analytical tools. This way, we decouple the objective of learning how to leverage data analytics effectively in our jobs (which is the primary focus of this book) from the requirement of learning how to program (which is, instead, an ancillary <span class="Italics--PACKT-">nice-to-have</span> for scaling and expanding the role of analytics even further).</p>
			<p class="normal">This guide offers an accessible journey through the most valuable techniques of data analytics, enabling you to move quickly from theory to practice using low-code environments. Although a large part of the content is application-agnostic and can be leveraged on any software you or your company decide to use, the book's tutorials are based on KNIME and Power BI.</p>
			<p class="normal">KNIME and Power BI were selected because they make the best travel buddies for your journey through data analytics. KNIME is the "Swiss Army knife" among the analytical platforms according to Gartner. Its graphical interface enables everyone—managers, analysts, and students—to automate data pipelines and employ machine learning algorithms without writing any line of code. One positive aspect to keep in mind is that visual analytics tools like KNIME are not simplistic and "depowered" versions of the "real thing." With KNIME, you can do full-on data science, including sophisticated data crunching and serious AI applications, such as creating deep neural networks. Microsoft Power BI requires no introduction: it is among the most popular data visualization and dashboarding tools. It provides a comprehensive environment to build self-service business intelligence interfaces that are omnipresent in supporting decision-making. Both Power BI and KNIME offer full access to their main functionalities without any capital investment. You can download them for free, enabling you to put into practice what you learn immediately. The combination of KNIME as back-end and Power BI (or Tableau, which is also introduced) as front-end is versatile and robust, empowering organizations to cover the full range of data capabilities, from descriptive to predictive and prescriptive analytics. This book's step-by-step tutorials—based on real business cases and data—will provide you with confidence through practice and make you an independent user of such a powerful software combo. The hands-on journey that waits for you in the following pages has a high ambition: making data analytics a trusted companion for your <span class="Italics--PACKT-">everyday</span> work.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p class="normal">The learning path offered by this book has been designed with three types of readers in mind:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbered"><span class="Key-Word--PACKT-">Knowledge workers</span> of any background, level, and functional expertise who use data to facilitate data-based decisions or inform others about the state of the business with reports, visuals, and ad-hoc analyses. They want to modernize and expand their data fluency to both <span class="Italics--PACKT-">simplify</span> their regular data-related chores and <span class="Italics--PACKT-">augment</span> their business impact. Today, they mainly use Excel to manage data and reports: they understand the need to upgrade to more powerful tools but do not know where to start and have zero programming experience. Even if proficient with Excel, they feel the need to automate their workflows to gain personal productivity. They would also like to build professional-looking, self-serve dashboards and automate as much as possible the process for updating them, so they can focus on interpreting the data and go beyond the plain figures. This book will give them the tools and techniques for reaching these objectives.</li>
				<li class="numbered"><span class="Key-Word--PACKT-">Business managers of any functional background</span>—including marketing, sales, finance, IT, and HR—who want to gain first-hand experience in data analytics to understand and unlock the true potential of data in their area of responsibility. They don't have the technical expertise and do not plan to become specialists but would like to understand what's possible and guide their teams through the required transformation. They want to be a source of help instead of a burden and are ready to roll up their sleeves and study. Today, many senior leaders appreciate the potential value of analytics but don't know how to make it happen in their organizations. This book will help them touch <span class="Italics--PACKT-">with their own hands</span> the value creation opportunities and finetune their expectations with their teams appropriately. How many of us dream of having bosses who know what they are asking for? This book makes managers aware, reasonable, and confident when setting expectations on business data analytics.</li>
				<li class="numbered"><span class="Key-Word--PACKT-">Business and data science students and junior professionals</span> who already have theoretical and academic knowledge but have little to zero business experience. They would like to see how their knowledge is used in companies in practice to have a <span class="Italics--PACKT-">vertical start-up</span> in their first jobs. After so much theory, compartmentalized across different disciplines (computer science, data science, statistics, and business), they crave experiencing the end-to-end process which leads from raw data to actionable business decisions. They are looking for a book full of real-world examples: this is exactly what they are going to get here.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="normal">No prior knowledge is required for any of these types of readers. The little math you will find around the chapters is always introduced very gently and stays to the level needed to put analytics "at work," leaving it to the readers to dive deeper as they please. I wrote this book to make data analytics accessible to <span class="Italics--PACKT-">everyone</span> who wants to invest some time to self-develop. I am thrilled that you are one of them.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p class="normal">The path I have prepared for you alternates two types of content. Some chapters equip you with the <span class="Key-Word--PACKT-">unmissable foundations of data analytics</span>—things like the basics of statistical learning, model validation, and data visualization principles. Other chapters provide <span class="Key-Word--PACKT-">practical guides on how to get things done</span> on your computer—like step-by-step tutorials on building a dashboard in Power BI or automating data crunching with KNIME. The two types of content are complementary and organized according to the following structure:</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="Chapterref--PACKT-">Chapter 1</em>,<em class="Italics--PACKT-">What is Data Analytics?</em>, paves the way for our journey together. This chapter equips you with the proper terminology and provides a few frameworks (such as the three types of analytics, the data technology stack, the matrix of data job roles and skills, and the data-to-value paths), offering you some broader perspective on the true business potential of data and algorithms.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="Chapterref--PACKT-">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="Italics--PACKT-">Getting Started with KNIME</em>, initiates you to KNIME and shows you how visual programming works by going through a few hands-on examples. The chapter includes the first tutorial of the book, in which you will create a routine for automating the clean-up of some consumer-generated data.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="Chapterref--PACKT-">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="Italics--PACKT-">Transforming Data</em>, introduces the concept of the data model and shows you how to apply systematic transformations to datasets and make them fully usable for analytics. You will learn how to combine tables, aggregate values, apply loops, and use variables. In the tutorial, you will build a workflow for creating some simple automated financial reports starting from raw transactional data.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="Chapterref--PACKT-">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="Italics--PACKT-">What is Machine Learning?</em>, separates the myth from the reality of intelligent machines able to autonomously learn from data. This chapter gives you the foundations of machine learning (like the taxonomy of available algorithms, how to validate models, and how to assess their accuracy) and lets you start identifying ways for AI to impact your actual work.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="Chapterref--PACKT-">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="Italics--PACKT-">Applying Machine Learning at Work</em>, puts in practice what you will have learned in the former chapter. Its three practical tutorials will let you experience what real-world machine learning is all about. You will feel the excitement of predicting real estate rental prices in Rome, anticipating the reaction of consumers in front of a bank marketing campaign, and segment customers of an online retailer. By following the tutorials, you will build your own "templates" of predictive machines that you can then adapt as needed to your specific business needs.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="Chapterref--PACKT-">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="Italics--PACKT-">Getting Started with Power BI</em>, prepares you to face an ever-present, primary need: building effective dashboards that "democratize" access to data and insights. In the tutorial, you will build a fully operating management dashboard in Power BI, including preparing the underlying data model and creating links across charts to drive interactivity.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="Chapterref--PACKT-">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="Italics--PACKT-">Visualizing Data Effectively</em>, explains how to build professional-looking data visualizations that transfer business insights. The chapter will give you a framework for selecting the correct type of chart according to your business need and a set of visual design guidelines ensuring that your business messages come across crisp, loud, and clear.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="Chapterref--PACKT-">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="Italics--PACKT-">Telling Stories with Data</em>, trains you to systematically prepare and deliver data stories that drive business action. Starting from the basic principles of persuasion, this chapter will teach you several techniques for making your data-based points as compelling as possible. The chapter will leave you with a structured template (the Data Storytelling Canvas) that you can keep on your desk and use when needed.</p>
			<p class="normal"><em class="Chapterref--PACKT-">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="Italics--PACKT-">Extending Your Toolbox</em>, lets you catch a glimpse of what's beyond the tools and techniques included in the previous chapters so that you can plan ahead for your next development steps. The chapter contains hands-on, guided demonstrations of Tableau, Python (including its integration with KNIME), and H2O.ai for automated machine learning. Reading this concluding chapter will prove the general value of the broad set of skills you will have acquired by completing this journey.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p class="normal">Let me share a few tips that will help along the path you are about to begin:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">The book comes with multiple step-by-step, hands-on tutorials that are integral to the development path I have designed for you. Some of the most subtle—and fascinating—aspects of data analytics (like the need to interact with business partners and go back-and-forth during the setup process) can only be understood through real examples: tutorials do a great job explaining them. I strongly suggest you set some quality time for completing each tutorial. The entire execution of a tutorial will take up to two hours: make sure you have access to a computer on which you can install all the required software.</li>
				<li class="bullet">At the end of the book, you will find a short series of useful resources organized by chapter. They offer an opportunity to complement your learning experience with selected additional readings. So don't forget to skim through them after you complete a chapter and see if any of them intrigues you.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Depending on your background, some parts of the book might feel less "natural" to you. This is normal. Don't get discouraged if any portion of the book is less clear: the chapters are all closely interconnected to each other, and you might find the answers to your doubts in some subsequent pages, so just keep going until the end. </li>
				<li class="bullet">Use the book's GitHub and KNIME Hub pages to download all the data you need to complete the tutorials. In there, you will also find the final result of each tutorial (like the complete KNIME workflow or the resulting Power BI dashboard). If you feel lost, you can refer to them to find your way forward.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Software improves and updates continuously. This book relies on the latest versions of KNIME and Power BI available at the time of its launch (precisely: KNIME 4.4 and Power BI 2.93). Although the bulk of the content will stay valid for a while, it might be that some of the steps in a tutorial change slightly, making the windows a bit different versus what you find in the figures. This is unavoidable and will not jeopardize your learning. Keep an eye on the book's web page for any <span class="Italics--PACKT-">errata</span> or addenda I post in case of any significant divergences due to a new version of the software. You can also get in touch with me using the contact details you find in the <span class="Italics--PACKT-">And Now?</span> section.</li>
				<li class="bullet">This book is targeted toward the "business application" of data analytics. For this reason, whenever I had to choose between a rigorous mathematical dissertation and a pragmatic and intuitive explanation of an analytical method, I went for the latter. The rationale is that you will always have the time to learn how to make statistical learning more accurate and dive deeper into the math behind the algorithms you will learn. Thus, the focus will stay on empowering you to use analytics in your work more than giving you the formal description behind each mathematical concept.</li>
