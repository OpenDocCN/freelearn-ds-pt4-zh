    data visualization, and storytelling are becoming essential in virtually any professional
    field. The necessity to acquire data fluency is not a thing for data scientists
    and analysts only: it is becoming a development objective for pretty much everyone,
    irrespectively of their education, experience, business function, and seniority
    level. It is a universal need.'

- en: For the majority of people interested in using analytics, learning how to code
    in a programming language is an intimidating barrier to break and—sadly—the first
    reason for abandoning their intent. For this reason, this book leverages low-code
    analytical tools. This way, we decouple the objective of learning how to leverage
    data analytics effectively in our jobs (which is the primary focus of this book)
    from the requirement of learning how to program (which is, instead, an ancillary
    nice-to-have for scaling and expanding the role of analytics even further).

- en: This guide offers an accessible journey through the most valuable techniques
    of data analytics, enabling you to move quickly from theory to practice using
    low-code environments. Although a large part of the content is application-agnostic
    and can be leveraged on any software you or your company decide to use, the book's
    tutorials are based on KNIME and Power BI.

    for your journey through data analytics. KNIME is the "Swiss Army knife" among
    the analytical platforms according to Gartner. Its graphical interface enables
    everyone—managers, analysts, and students—to automate data pipelines and employ
    machine learning algorithms without writing any line of code. One positive aspect
    to keep in mind is that visual analytics tools like KNIME are not simplistic and
    "depowered" versions of the "real thing." With KNIME, you can do full-on data
    science, including sophisticated data crunching and serious AI applications, such
    as creating deep neural networks. Microsoft Power BI requires no introduction:
    it is among the most popular data visualization and dashboarding tools. It provides
    a comprehensive environment to build self-service business intelligence interfaces
    that are omnipresent in supporting decision-making. Both Power BI and KNIME offer
    full access to their main functionalities without any capital investment. You
    can download them for free, enabling you to put into practice what you learn immediately.
    The combination of KNIME as back-end and Power BI (or Tableau, which is also introduced)
    as front-end is versatile and robust, empowering organizations to cover the full
    range of data capabilities, from descriptive to predictive and prescriptive analytics.
    This book''s step-by-step tutorials—based on real business cases and data—will
    provide you with confidence through practice and make you an independent user
    of such a powerful software combo. The hands-on journey that waits for you in
    the following pages has a high ambition: making data analytics a trusted companion
    for your everyday work.'

    data to facilitate data-based decisions or inform others about the state of the
    business with reports, visuals, and ad-hoc analyses. They want to modernize and
    expand their data fluency to both simplify their regular data-related chores and
    augment their business impact. Today, they mainly use Excel to manage data and
    reports: they understand the need to upgrade to more powerful tools but do not
    know where to start and have zero programming experience. Even if proficient with
    Excel, they feel the need to automate their workflows to gain personal productivity.
    They would also like to build professional-looking, self-serve dashboards and
    automate as much as possible the process for updating them, so they can focus
    on interpreting the data and go beyond the plain figures. This book will give
    them the tools and techniques for reaching these objectives.'

    IT, and HR—who want to gain first-hand experience in data analytics to understand
    and unlock the true potential of data in their area of responsibility. They don't
    have the technical expertise and do not plan to become specialists but would like
    to understand what's possible and guide their teams through the required transformation.
    They want to be a source of help instead of a burden and are ready to roll up
    their sleeves and study. Today, many senior leaders appreciate the potential value
    of analytics but don't know how to make it happen in their organizations. This
    book will help them touch with their own hands the value creation opportunities
    and finetune their expectations with their teams appropriately. How many of us
    dream of having bosses who know what they are asking for? This book makes managers
    aware, reasonable, and confident when setting expectations on business data analytics.

    across different disciplines (computer science, data science, statistics, and

- en: 'The path I have prepared for you alternates two types of content. Some chapters
    equip you with the unmissable foundations of data analytics—things like the basics
    of statistical learning, model validation, and data visualization principles.
    Other chapters provide practical guides on how to get things done on your computer—like
    step-by-step tutorials on building a dashboard in Power BI or automating data
    crunching with KNIME. The two types of content are complementary and organized
    according to the following structure:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*,*What is Data Analytics?*, paves the way for our journey together.
    This chapter equips you with the proper terminology and provides a few frameworks
    (such as the three types of analytics, the data technology stack, the matrix of
    data job roles and skills, and the data-to-value paths), offering you some broader
    perspective on the true business potential of data and algorithms.'

    for automating the clean-up of some consumer-generated data.'

    and shows you how to apply systematic transformations to datasets and make them
    fully usable for analytics. You will learn how to combine tables, aggregate values,
    apply loops, and use variables. In the tutorial, you will build a workflow for
    creating some simple automated financial reports starting from raw transactional
    data.'

    of intelligent machines able to autonomously learn from data. This chapter gives
    you the foundations of machine learning (like the taxonomy of available algorithms,
    how to validate models, and how to assess their accuracy) and lets you start identifying
    ways for AI to impact your actual work.'

    excitement of predicting real estate rental prices in Rome, anticipating the reaction
    of consumers in front of a bank marketing campaign, and segment customers of an

    for a while, it might be that some of the steps in a tutorial change slightly,
    making the windows a bit different versus what you find in the figures. This is

    this reason, whenever I had to choose between a rigorous mathematical dissertation
    and a pragmatic and intuitive explanation of an analytical method, I went for
    the latter. The rationale is that you will always have the time to learn how to
    make statistical learning more accurate and dive deeper into the math behind the
    algorithms you will learn. Thus, the focus will stay on empowering you to use
    analytics in your work more than giving you the formal description behind each
    mathematical concept.
