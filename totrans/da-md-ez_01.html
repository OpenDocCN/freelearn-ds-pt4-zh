			<p class="normal">Before we start our journey across the vast and exciting land of <strong class="keyword">data analytics</strong>, it is wise to get equipped with an up-to-date map that can show us the way. In this chapter, you will cover all those fundamental concepts you need to visualize, with clarity, the role of data analytics in companies. This will let you spot opportunities for leveraging data and decide how to distill business value out of it. You also want to feel confident about the naming conventions adopted in this domain to avoid any confusion and speak decisively with those around you. Given the hectic development of data analytics these days, it is a wise choice to build a robust foundation of the key concepts before getting our hands dirty with tables and algorithms.</p>
			<p class="normal">Specifically, within this chapter, you will find answers to the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">What types of analytics can we find in companies?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Who should be designing, maintaining, and using them?</li>
				<li class="bullet">What technology is required for data analytics to work?</li>
				<li class="bullet">What is the data analytics toolbox and what does it contain?</li>
				<li class="bullet">How can data be transformed into business value?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">Although this initial part of this book is more theoretical than the rest of it, let me make a promise: all the concepts you'll encounter are there to enable a better understanding of what you'll find ahead in your journey as a data analytics practitioner. We are now fully ready to go; let's get started!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Three types of data analytics</h1>
			<p class="normal">The term<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> data analytics normally denotes those processes and techniques used to extract some sort of value from data. Sometimes, the same term indicates the actual tools used to make this transformation happen. In any case, data analytics represents <em class="italic">how</em> we can transform crude data into something more actionable and valuable. We can recognize three different types of data analytics, each one carrying its own set of <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>peculiarities and possible applications: <strong class="keyword">descriptive</strong>, <strong class="keyword">predictive</strong>, and <strong class="keyword">prescriptive analytics</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-17" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Descriptive analytics</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="keyword">Descriptive analytics</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>unmissable "bread and butter" of any analytical effort. These methodologies focus on describing past data to make it digestible and <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>useable as required by the business need. They answer the generic question "what happened?" by leveraging summary statistics (like average, median, and variance) and simple transformations and aggregations (like indices, counts, and sums), ultimately displaying the results through tables and visuals. The iconic (and most basic) deliverable within the camp of descriptive analytics is the <em class="italic">standalone report</em>: this can be a file in a portable format (PDF documents and Excel worksheets are the most popular ones) that is distributed on a regular basis via email or posted in a shared repository. Most <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>managers love reports as they can find all the <strong class="keyword">Key Performance Indicators</strong> (<strong class="keyword">KPIs</strong>) of interest at hand, with minimal effort from their side. In fact, they don't need to "go and look" for anything: it's data by itself coming their way, right in the format they need. A more sophisticated deliverable within descriptive analytics is the <em class="italic">interactive dashboard</em>: in this case, users access a web-based interface from which they are guided through their data of interest. Visuals and tables will display the most relevant aspects of the business, while filters, selectors, and buttons offer users the possibility to customize their journey through data, drilling down into the aspects they are mostly intrigued by. Sometimes, dashboards are specifically designed to please senior executives, focusing on top KPIs only: in this case, they are known by the more picturesque name of <em class="italic">management cockpits</em>. If the standalone report gives you a preset guided tour, interactive dashboards will let you drive yourself through your data, giving you the possibility to take unusual paths. Although the latter have clearly more potential in relation to their ability to unveil useful insights, some less adventurous managers will still prefer the comfort of receiving standalone reports directly in their inbox. To please both cases at once, dashboards can be set to offer subscriptions: in this case, users can sign up to receive a selection of visuals or tables from the dashboard via email regularly, or as soon as the data changes. Subscriptions are a promising feature as they avoid the duplication of efforts in updating dashboards and disseminating reports.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-18" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Predictive analytics</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="keyword">Predictive analytics</strong> focuses <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>on answering the natural follow-up questions that<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> you have after learning what happened in the past, such as: "why did it happen?" and "what will happen now?". These methodologies leverage more sophisticated techniques, including AI, to go beyond the mere description of historical facts. By using them, we can make sense of the causal relationships that lie under our data and extrapolate them, to show what the future is most likely going to look like. The simplest examples of predictive analytics are <strong class="keyword">diagnostic tools</strong>: they<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> enrich the more traditional descriptive reports with a model-based inference of possible causes behind what we see in data. By using basic methods like correlation analysis, control charting, and tests of statistical significance, these tools can highlight interesting patterns, shedding light on the reasons why the business is going in a certain way. The next level of sophistication is brought by <strong class="keyword">business alerts</strong>: in this case, diagnostic <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>checks are carried out automatically and users get notified when some situation of<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> business interest (like the market share for a brand going below a certain threshold) arises. Similarly, in the case of <strong class="keyword">anomaly detection</strong>, algorithms <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>continuously inspect data to find any inconsistency in patterns and flag it as such, so it can be managed accordingly: for instance, the data generated by sensors in a production line can be used to spot malfunctions early on and trigger the required maintenance. Predictive analytics also includes methods that anticipate the future by generating <em class="italic">forecasts</em> of measures, such as sales, price, market size, and level of risk, all of which can certainly help managers make better decisions and prepare for what's about to come. Also, the <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>behavior of individual entities like consumers and competitors can be forecasted, producing a competitive advantage and an improved <strong class="keyword">Return on Investment</strong> (<strong class="keyword">ROI</strong>) of <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>forthcoming activities. In the<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> case of <strong class="keyword">propensity models</strong>, AI is leveraged to predict how much a customer is going to like a commercial offer, or how likely are they to leave our store or service (churn), enabling us to finetune our retention activities. One last example of predictive analytics is when we use data and algorithms to create smart <em class="italic">segmentations</em> of our business, like when we're grouping together similar customers, stores, or products. By tailoring the way we manage them, we can make our operations more efficient and the experience of our customers more personalized and engaging.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Prescriptive analytics</h2>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="keyword">Prescriptive analytics</strong> transforms<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> data into a recommended course of <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>action, by answering the ultimate question every business manager has: "what should be done?". If descriptive and predictive analytics produces insights and informs us about our business, prescriptive analytics is certainly more assertive and direct: it tells us what to do. For example, it can simulate a large set of alternative scenarios and implement <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>a <strong class="keyword">systematic optimization</strong> across them: the output would be the "best recipe" to follow to maximize profit or minimize cost, given the current conditions. Other examples of prescriptive analytics are the so-called <strong class="keyword">recommendation systems</strong>: essentially, they<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> provide users with recommendations on products. These algorithms are virtually omnipresent in our everyday digital experience. When we shop around on Amazon or struggle to pick which TV series to binge watch next on Netflix, we are going to be presented with the output of some recommendation systems, offering us a limited number of options<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> we are likely going to like. The ultimate level of sophistication comes when prescriptive analytics is not only recommending what to do but is in charge of doing it! In fact, when they are run in real time, no human being might be able to fully control and explicitly approve every decision or recommendation that the machine has come up with. In some cases, algorithms are designed to behave like <strong class="keyword">autonomous agents</strong>: these are in<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> charge of learning through an iterative <strong class="keyword">trial and error</strong> process. They <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>will continuously test their strategy in the real world and correct it as necessary, with the ultimate objective of maximizing returns in the long term. This is what happens, for instance, with automated trading (a rising trend in FinTech) and programmatic advertising (which is the real-time buying of digital media through automatic bids).</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer007" class="note">
					<p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">You will find in your readings that, as a naming convention, the descriptive layer is mostly associated <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>with the term <strong class="keyword">Business Intelligence</strong>, while predictive and prescriptive analytics are known by <strong class="keyword">Advanced Analytics</strong>. Since<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> there are no clear cuts across these domains, sometimes, it can get confusing – don't worry, it's normal.</p>

			<p class="normal">Over the course of this book, you will encounter all types of data analytics, and you will learn how to make them come true in your business. <em class="italic">Figure 1.1</em> shows the trade-off between the potential value and complexity of these different types of analytics:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Data analytics in action</h2>
			<p class="normal">Now that we have<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> grasped the fundamentals behind descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, it's time to see them in action. Katia is the proud <strong class="keyword">Chief Data Officer</strong> (<strong class="keyword">CDO</strong>) of a <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>multinational hotel chain. Let's see how she summarizes a list of data analytics capabilities they have put together in the last few years:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">Board members receive a 5-page report every month via email. It includes a short executive summary prepared by analysts with key highlights and a set of standard tables and charts with KPI trends by country, banner, and hotel type.</li>
				<li class="bullet">All managers have access to an online dashboard that's refreshed every week with top measures of interest and the possibility to drill down to very granular views, such as the latest occupancy levels of individual hotels or current room rates.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Area managers are subscribed to an alerting tool that notifies them when some facilities are off course to meeting their monthly goals. An automated email is sent when the forecast for the month is below a certain threshold versus targets.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Room rates are dynamically managed by a central system, which they've called <strong class="keyword">AutoPrice</strong>. The system simulates different occupancy levels by facility, taking into account seasonality, trends, and interest displayed by web users. <strong class="keyword">AutoPrice</strong> can adjust room rates daily so as to maximize profit, given the expected sales and costs.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Customers who are part of the reward program occasionally receive special offers for room upgrades or weekend escapes in luxury hotels. A propensity model tailors the offer (controlling the level of discount) to maximize redemption and expected profit.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Newsletter subscribers are grouped into four homogeneous segments (Business, Families, Deal-hunters, and Premium) according to their sociodemographic traits and interests. The content of each monthly newsletter is diversified by segment. Every new subscriber is automatically associated with a segment when they sign up.</li>
				<li class="bullet">When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, analysts built a statistical model to anticipate the upcoming impact on sales by country and built alternative scenarios of evolution. Based on this work, the company put together a successful response plan, which included temporary closures and down-staffing, conversions of restaurants into takeaway services, and conversions of rooms for low-care infected patients in partnership with local authorities.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Following <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>the launch of a competitive chain in France, the digital marketing team partnered with data scientists to build a data-enabled reaction plan to boost communication activities in the areas with the biggest risk of losing customers. Additionally, they built a churn model to send individual retention offers to those members who were most inclined to move to a new competitor.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">We have to stop Katia right now; otherwise, she would go on and on for a few more pages! All these examples show how pervasive and versatile data analytics can be for a business. They also give us the opportunity to notice some general patterns whose value goes beyond the hotel chain's case:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">The three types of data analytics are not necessarily alternative to each other. In truth, they tend to co-exist in companies – you don't have to "pick" one. For example, you will always have a need for ongoing descriptive analytics, such as reports for management or dashboards, even if you have some forward-looking, advanced analytics tricks up your sleeve. You can't just "ignore" the basics; otherwise, you'll receive less traction for everything else.</li>
				<li class="bullet">The same aspect of a business might get value from each of the three types of analytics. Take pricing in the example of the hotel: you can report average room rates (descriptive), you can forecast scenarios based on different prices (predictive), or you can automatically set the best room rates (prescriptive). For each aspect of the business, there is an opportunity for each type of analytics.</li>
				<li class="bullet">The different types of analytics can partially overlap and cross-enrich. For example, in the management dashboard (descriptive), we might add some different color coding, depending on the likelihood that a hotel is going to meet its target for the year (predictive).</li>
				<li class="bullet">Some opportunities to create value through data analytics are ad hoc, contingent on specific one-off circumstances: this was the case for the COVID-19 model and the response to a competitive move. Others are ongoing and systematic, like the regular reports and updates to the dashboard or real-time price optimization. Data analytics can bring value to both ad hoc and ongoing cases.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">Thanks to this <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>example, we now have a clearer picture of what the three different levels of analytics look like. Before moving on to the next topic, it's worth thinking about what differentiates business intelligence (descriptive) from advanced analytics (predictive and prescriptive) in terms of business impact, like <em class="italic">Table 1.1</em> summarizes:</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Table 1.1: Business impact of different analytics</p>
			<p class="normal">Descriptive analytics tends to have a broad set of potential users in the company. The same dashboards and reports can be of use for many colleagues across different levels of seniority, business units, and functions. Indeed, one of the widespread feelings in companies is that "data is there, but not sure where": the more data can be democratized with a solid business intelligence offering, the more its value is unlocked. Considering the potential breadth of the user base these capabilities have, it's worth planning well for "mass" deployment activities so that everyone has the opportunity to become a user and the business impact of the capability is maximized. Often, dashboards are underutilized in the long run – or simply forgotten – because people don't know how to use them: an even bigger reason to plan for regular training sessions is to keep them accessible to everyone, including newcomers.</p>
			<p class="normal">Needless to say, the complexity of designing and implementing predictive and prescriptive analytics is higher than for descriptive. You will require skilled business analysts and data scientists (we'll talk more about roles in the next few pages), and the time needed for prototyping, and then deploying and scaling, is normally more. Hence, it's worth proceeding with an agile and iterative mode, so as to unlock incremental value progressively and avoid losing the momentum and the enthusiasm from stakeholders.</p>
			<p class="normal">Advanced analytics has <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>a tougher job to get accepted within a company and requires a more decisive sponsorship from senior managers to go through. Think about that: descriptive analytics enables better decisions by informing people about what's going on. On the other end, prescriptive analytics will bluntly tell you what the best decision you can make is, potentially restricting the ability of managers' gut feelings to guide the business. Algorithms who are "in charge" of decisions require higher trust to be accepted than just plain reports. The more you progress to advanced analytics, the more you need to involve top management and have them sponsor the transformation. This will counterbalance the natural tendency of people to "protect" their role and power against all threats, including those algorithms that assertively prescribe decisions.</p>
			<p class="normal">Like most things in life, you get what you pay for. Advanced analytics is more complex to build and requires more management attention, but the potential value it can unlock is higher than what descriptive analytics can do. My advice is to look for opportunities to progressively elevate the role of analytics, moving the footprint of your capabilities toward the advanced end of the ladder. At the same time, you don't want to "forget" about the power of enabling a broad set of colleagues to manage their business in a smarter way, through democratized access to data via descriptive analytics.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Who is involved in data analytics?</h1>
			<p class="normal">The short<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> answer to the heading of this section is also the most obvious: everyone has a role to play in data analytics – nobody is excluded! In fact, all knowledge workers will undoubtedly have to deal with data as part of their job: they will interact with analytics in one way or another, either solely as a passive user or all the way to the other end of engagement, as the main creator and owner of data capabilities. We can recognize four families of roles with regard to data analytics in companies: <strong class="keyword">business users</strong>, <strong class="keyword">business analysts</strong>, <strong class="keyword">data scientists</strong>, and <strong class="keyword">data engineers</strong>.

			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Business users</strong> of any<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> function and level, including senior <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>managers, surely interact with data analytics to some extent. Although their main role is being a user, they will highly benefit from having a basic understanding of data analysis and storytelling techniques. These will enable business users to make the most out of the data as they integrate it with their business knowledge, interpret it properly, and communicate insights through effective visualizations and stories. Also, their personal productivity will be positively affected by knowing how to automate their routine "data crunching" work, using macros in Excel or, as we will learn later, workflows in KNIME. Lastly, they should have a basic understanding of what advanced analytics could do for them and acquire the fundamental concepts behind machine learning and its algorithms. They clearly don't need to become experts in this. However, until they see "what's possible," they will miss anticipating opportunities to impact their business with data.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Business analysts</strong> (or data analysts) play the fundamental role of uniting the two – apparently detached – worlds of <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>business and data. They have<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> a very solid understanding of the business dynamics (market, customer, and competitor landscape) as they are constantly in touch with partners from all functions (sales, marketing, finance, and so on). Thanks to their strong business background, they can proactively intercept opportunities for analytics to make the difference and "translate" business needs into technical requirements for the next data capability to meet. Business analysts are proficient with data analysis (as they need to constantly "peel the onion" and extract business-relevant insights from large quantities of data) and storytelling (since they want their data findings to make strong impacts and drive action). At the same time, they are familiar with machine learning concepts: they will use them directly to solve their business needs, but also to prototype advanced analytics capabilities before leaving them in the capable hands of data scientists for scaling. Although not strictly required and not a focus <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>for their job, they <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>can benefit from having basic coding abilities to build queries for data extraction and untangle the more tedious data transformation steps.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Data scientists</strong> focus <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>on designing and scaling advanced <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>analytics capabilities. They are the recognized experts of machine learning algorithms and can implement predictive and prescriptive analytics from scratch or build upon existing prototypes. They collaborate closely with business analysts, through whom they stay in touch with the "latest" business necessities, and data engineers, their primary partners for ensuring sustainability and scale to data capabilities. Data scientists are proficient at coding, especially when it comes to applying advanced transformations to data and leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning libraries.</li>

					<p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Data science is <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>the multidisciplinary field at the intersection of maths, statistics, and computer science that studies the systematic extraction of value from data. Everyone – not only data scientists – can benefit from using some aspects of data science.</p>
				</div>
			<ul>
			
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Data engineers</strong> (and related roles, like systems engineers and data architects) ensure the systemic<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> functioning of analytics by dealing with the <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>technological complexity of the underlying data infrastructure. The work of data engineers is essential to building stable data pipelines and maintaining them to make sure they are consistently available. They interact with both data scientists – to adequately size storage and computational resources and to design a fitting data architecture – and with the rest of the <strong class="keyword">Information Technology</strong> (<strong class="keyword">IT</strong>) functions – to guarantee compatibility across corporate systems and ensure acceptable standards of information security.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">These four actors, each with its specific part to perform, will jointly cover for the vast majority of interactions with data analytics in a company. Whichever character you feel closer with, you certainly have a role to play in extracting value from data. In the next section, you'll meet the tools that will let you perform at your best.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Technology for data analytics</h1>
			<p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>technology that empowers data analytics in a company does not look like a monolithic body. In fact, there are several hardware and software systems involved. For simplicity, you can think of them as being organized into three layers: these are piled upon each other and form the <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>so-called <strong class="keyword">Technology Stack</strong>. Every layer relies on the one below to function properly. Let's take a bottom-up "helicopter" view of the fundamental features that you need to know about for each layer of the stack:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">The underlying <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>layer is the <strong class="keyword">Physical Infrastructure</strong>. This is stuff you can touch. It is made up of servers or mainframe computers that store and process data. Companies can decide to either build and maintain a physical infrastructure of their own (normally kept in corporate <em class="italic">data centers</em>) or rely on <em class="italic">cloud providers</em> from whom they rent only the required resources.</li>
				<li class="bullet">The middle layer<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> is the <strong class="keyword">Data Platform</strong>. The technology at this level implements a logical organization of the data stored in the infrastructure (<em class="italic">data architecture</em>) and the available computing power. Even if data resides in different databases, at the platform level, it gets virtually unified on a simpler, more harmonious view.</li>
				<li class="bullet">The top layer is <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>made of <strong class="keyword">Applications</strong>. Here is where data analytics methods get implemented into user-facing apps. Applications leverage both the organized data and the horsepower provided by the underpinning platform to serve users in different ways. Some applications will provide interfaces for users to explore data, to make sense of it and to identify insights (<em class="italic">Business Intelligence</em>); others will enable expert users to take it to the next level and to build predictions or prescriptions (<em class="italic">Advanced Analytics</em>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">This three-layer stack model is certainly a simplification versus the multifaceted reality underneath real-world data infrastructures. However, it gives us the benefit of envisioning, at once, the different levels of abstraction that data can have and introduces several challenges that come with it:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_01_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.2: Technology Stack supporting data analytics. The arrows clarify which roles interact with which layers of the stack</p>
			<p class="normal">The four roles<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> we have seen earlier will "operate" at different levels of the technology stack. Data engineers will deal with the complexity of the data infrastructure and its organization in a platform. Data scientists will normally leverage applications of advanced analytics to build models and will sometimes access data directly at the platform level to enjoy maximum versatility. Business analysts will feel at ease with both advanced analytics tools and business intelligence apps, which they can also use to design actionable data exploration routes for others. Business users will solely interact with easy-to-use business intelligence interfaces: all the complexities related to storing data and its organization in the platform will be conveniently far from their sight.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>The data analytics toolbox</h1>
			<p class="normal">Out of all the <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>technologies related to data analytics, this book is going to focus on the application layer. This is where the "magic" happens: analytics applications can transform data into actual business value and in the next chapters, you will learn how to do this.</p>
			<p class="normal">There are many data analytics applications out there available for use. Each of them has its strengths and peculiarities. Although some can be very versatile, no single application will satisfy the full range of analytical needs we could encounter on our way. Hence, we should pick a selection of tools that will jointly cover an acceptable range of needs: they form our <strong class="keyword">data analytics toolbox</strong>. By learning how to use and how to effectively combine the few tools we have put in the toolbox, we can become autonomous data analytics practitioners. Like a plumber would have his or her preferences on the instruments to use, you will also have your own predilections and can customize your toolbox to your personal tastes. You just want to ensure you pick the right mix of tool types, so that you have a broad range of functionalities readily available to you.</p>
			<p class="normal">Let's go through the different types of tools that qualify for being added to our toolbox:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Spreadsheets</strong>: Although <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>their analytics ability is quite limited, spreadsheet applications are virtually omnipresent because of their ease of use and extended<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> portability that facilitates sharing data with colleagues. Nearly everyone is able to open a <em class="italic">Microsoft Excel</em> file (or its open source alternative, <em class="italic">OpenOffice Calc</em>, or a cloud-based service such as <em class="italic">Google Sheets</em>) and add simple formula calculations to it. They can also be very helpful when creating simple, one-off data visualizations: their level of graphic customization is good enough for many day-to-day data presentation needs. On the other side, spreadsheet software is inadequate for creating robust and automated data workflows: refreshing even a simple report created in Excel requires manual steps and is prone to human error.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Business Intelligence</strong>: These are<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> the most-suited tools for creating <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>advanced data visualizations and interactive dashboards. Tools like <em class="italic">Microsoft Power BI</em>, <em class="italic">QlikView/Qlik Sense</em>, <em class="italic">Tableau,</em> and <em class="italic">TIBCO Spotfire</em> let you implement user-friendly data apps with the objective of democratizing data and making it accessible to the masses. They have a vast choice of visuals to render and the possibility to link charts so as to enable a guided data exploration experience. Although some have algorithms implemented, advanced analytics is not their natural strength: they are, instead, best suited for enabling descriptive analytics at scale:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_01_03.png" alt=""/></figure></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.3: A dashboard built with Qlik Sense – the navigation pane on the left guides you through the different aspects to visualize</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Low-code analytics</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> tools enable you to rapidly build advanced analytics<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> workflows without having to write code. Their "secret" is the workflow-based user interface: by composing a flow chart made of incremental data transformation steps and customizable modeling modules, you can build a fully operating analytics application in record time. Because of their intuitive interface and lack of coding requirements, tools like <em class="italic">KNIME</em>, <em class="italic">RapidMiner</em>, and <em class="italic">Alteryx Designer</em> can be used by expert data professionals (like data scientists and business analysts, to quickly prototype advanced capabilities), as well as non-data-focused knowledge workers (who are looking for ways to automate their time-consuming, regular data reporting activities):<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_01_04.jpg" alt=""/></figure></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.4: User interface of Alteryx Designer – each icon is a transformation step through the data flow</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Code-based analytics</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>most traditional approach to<a id="_idIndexMarker054"/> advanced analytics is to write code using data science-friendly languages such as Python, R, and Scala. Considering the vast availability of machine learning libraries written in these languages, a data scientist can use them to build highly customized and efficient analytics solutions. These can then be embedded in real-time applications and scaled across the company as needed. To do so, data professionals will use <strong class="keyword">Integrated Development Environments</strong> (<strong class="keyword">IDEs</strong>) such<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> as RStudio for R and Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio, or PyCharm for Python:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_01_05.jpg" alt=""/></figure></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.5: A screenshot of a Jupyter Notebook – you can run your Python code through a web interface</p>
			<p class="normal">You should not <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>consider these four types of analytics as alternatives to choose from. Actually, it's quite the opposite – they have complementary strengths and weaknesses, and gracefully integrate into one another. Let's consider an example: Laura is a supply chain data analyst working for a car manufacturer. She needs to quickly put together a capability that's able to forecast the future demand for parts at the production line level, and then make results available to a number of purchasing analysts and plant managers across the globe. Laura decides to build a workflow in KNIME that pulls historical demand levels from a few corporate databases and combines it with inventory actuals. After an initial exploration phase, Laura builds a predictive model of demand using KNIME's native functionalities and – later – optimizes it by adding some custom line of Python code directly into KNIME. After that, Laura completes her workflow with the last clean-up steps and exports the forecast results directly into a Power BI dataset. Lastly, Laura builds a simple dashboard made of a few tables and simple line charts in Power BI that enable end users to explore the data, filter it to their area of interest, and export it into a handy Excel file for further analysis and sharing.</p>
			<p class="normal">Laura was able to rapidly put together this great piece of work because she used her whole analytics toolbox made of KNIME, Power BI, and a little bit of Python. She skillfully picked which tool to use by leveraging their strengths and fitting them to her specific needs. Without a versatile toolbox at hand, Laura would have struggled to meet the stringent timing requirement that her business case required.</p>
			<p class="normal">The story of Laura proves vividly the need to build a versatile data analytics toolbox: whatever your role is, having a selection of complementary tools for transforming, enriching, modeling, and visualizing data is going to give you an advantage in your everyday data needs.</p>
			<p class="normal">In the rest of this book, I'll get you started with a pre-built "kit" made of a selection of tools that work very well together: KNIME and Power BI. These tools are quite powerful for multiple reasons. First of all, they can be downloaded and installed on your computer for free. Although both also offer a paid version, you will often find that the freely available versions<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> provide plenty of functionality for the vast majority of your regular needs. The other advantage is that neither of them strictly requires any coding. This means that you can fully benefit from this toolkit without necessarily having to become a proficient Python or R programmer, making it a suitable kit for every professional who uses data, not just expert data scientists. For those who, instead, know how to program, this kit can be expanded further by integrating snippets of code, like Laura did in her project. Lastly, KNIME and Power BI are particularly well-suited to each other. If you look at <em class="italic">Figure 1.6</em>, they jointly cover most of the needs you might encounter, from data automation and advanced machine learning to professional-looking data visualization and dashboarding:</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.6: A comparison across multiple tools for data analytics – one size does not fit all</p>
			<p class="normal">Before we start building our data analytics toolbox, let's understand the various ways we can create real value out of it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>From data to business value</h1>
			<p class="normal">Data is nothing without its chance to be transformed into value. However sophisticated and accurate our model is, whatever profound insights we manage to unveil, data will make a difference only when it finally drives some action that positively impacts the business. The bad news is that driving actions might be quite complex and often more difficult than building a powerful data capability. The good news is that we have not just one but multiple ways to impact the <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>business with analytics: we call them <strong class="keyword">data-to-value paths</strong>. It's important to have them clear in our mind before we start working on data, so that we can maximize the business relevance of what we build right from the start. The three most frequent data-to-value paths you can encounter in business are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Ad hoc analytics</strong>: In <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>this case, you use data to influence a specific decision or to shed light on a unique opportunity or threat. This is the most time-consuming path to follow, as it certainly requires a lot of human interaction, but can also be extremely rewarding. By means of data exploration and, if necessary, leveraging some predictive algorithms, you start your path by identifying an insight hidden in the data. To maximize its chance of impact, you then build an engaging story that is able to bring decision makers onboard with you and willing to make the right decision. Only when (and if) this decision comes to life and gets transformed into action will you be in the position of claiming economic value thanks to data analytics. Many insightful data discoveries <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>were never implemented because some steps along this path failed. Sometimes, the story is not well-prepared and delivered, making a good recommendation unheard. In other cases, the data-based plans are not followed through because they were not well-explained or tracked. In the rest of this book, you will learn how to maximize the chances for your ad hoc analytics to make it to actual value.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Ongoing Business Intelligence</strong>: When you follow this path, your aim is to systematically enlighten managers with relevant information. This will make them better at what they do and ultimately maximize the value coming from their work. By means of <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>descriptive analytics and, when necessary, using some diagnostics algorithms, you make the data "speak loud and clear" through visuals and alerts. By enriching others through data analytics, you generate better actions and, so, add incremental value to the business. This data-to-value path might be less sophisticated than the others, but it carries a large potential for value creation as it can impact the work of many people and in a continuous manner. Later in this book, you will learn how to make the most out of data capabilities enabling ongoing business intelligence.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Automatic optimization</strong>: As you take this path, you use prescriptive analytics to obtain<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> a plan of action to be taken and automatically follow through with it. In this case, the data and algorithm are not informing others or recommending a course of action: they are put in the driving seat and can steer the execution of business processes. The potential benefit is vast since algorithms can continuously optimize the performance of the company's operations without any human intervention or, at most, with some moderate supervision:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_01_07.png" alt=""/></figure></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.7: The three most frequent data-to-value paths – which one will you follow first?</p>
			<p class="normal">It will be <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>important to identify which data-to-value path we want to pursue on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the route we take, we might need to implement a certain type of data analytics and pick specific tools from our toolbox. In any case, having clarity on how we want to create value for a business will maximize our chance of success.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="normal">This chapter gave you all the background you needed to begin your journey through the practice of data analytics. We saw the differences between the three types of analytics (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive) and recognized the underlying potential value of each. We realized how virtually everyone in a company can benefit from using data analytics and familiarized ourselves with the different roles and skills required across business users, analysts, data scientists, and engineers. We glimpsed at the complexity of the full technology stack required for analytics to work: specifically, we went through the tools that data analytics practitioners should keep handy in their toolbox, spotting the value of the KNIME/Power BI couple. At last, we distinguished between the several paths that data can take to be transformed into actual business value.</p>
			<p class="normal">I hope that the last few pages convinced you even further of the massive business potential hidden in data. It's now time to get our hands dirty and, in the next chapter, meet one of our precious travel companions through the land of analytics: KNIME.</p>
