    it is wise to get equipped with an up-to-date map that can show us the way. In
    this chapter, you will cover all those fundamental concepts you need to visualize,
    with clarity, the role of data analytics in companies. This will let you spot
    opportunities for leveraging data and decide how to distill business value out
    of it. You also want to feel confident about the naming conventions adopted in
    this domain to avoid any confusion and speak decisively with those around you.
    Given the hectic development of data analytics these days, it is a wise choice
    to build a robust foundation of the key concepts before getting our hands dirty
    with tables and algorithms.

    effort. These methodologies focus on describing past data to make it digestible
    and useable as required by the business need. They answer the generic question
    "what happened?" by leveraging summary statistics (like average, median, and variance)
    and simple transformations and aggregations (like indices, counts, and sums),
    ultimately displaying the results through tables and visuals. The iconic (and
    most basic) deliverable within the camp of descriptive analytics is the *standalone
    report*: this can be a file in a portable format (PDF documents and Excel worksheets
    are the most popular ones) that is distributed on a regular basis via email or
    posted in a shared repository. Most managers love reports as they can find all
    the **Key Performance Indicators** (**KPIs**) of interest at hand, with minimal
    effort from their side. In fact, they don''t need to "go and look" for anything:
    it''s data by itself coming their way, right in the format they need. A more sophisticated
    deliverable within descriptive analytics is the *interactive dashboard*: in this
    case, users access a web-based interface from which they are guided through their
    data of interest. Visuals and tables will display the most relevant aspects of
    the business, while filters, selectors, and buttons offer users the possibility
    to customize their journey through data, drilling down into the aspects they are
    mostly intrigued by. Sometimes, dashboards are specifically designed to please
    senior executives, focusing on top KPIs only: in this case, they are known by
    the more picturesque name of *management cockpits*. If the standalone report gives
    you a preset guided tour, interactive dashboards will let you drive yourself through
    your data, giving you the possibility to take unusual paths. Although the latter
    have clearly more potential in relation to their ability to unveil useful insights,
    some less adventurous managers will still prefer the comfort of receiving standalone
    reports directly in their inbox. To please both cases at once, dashboards can
    be set to offer subscriptions: in this case, users can sign up to receive a selection
    of visuals or tables from the dashboard via email regularly, or as soon as the
    data changes. Subscriptions are a promising feature as they avoid the duplication
    of efforts in updating dashboards and disseminating reports.'

    that you have after learning what happened in the past, such as: "why did it happen?"
    and "what will happen now?". These methodologies leverage more sophisticated techniques,
    including AI, to go beyond the mere description of historical facts. By using
    them, we can make sense of the causal relationships that lie under our data and
    extrapolate them, to show what the future is most likely going to look like. The
    simplest examples of predictive analytics are **diagnostic tools**: they enrich
    the more traditional descriptive reports with a model-based inference of possible
    causes behind what we see in data. By using basic methods like correlation analysis,
    control charting, and tests of statistical significance, these tools can highlight
    interesting patterns, shedding light on the reasons why the business is going
    in a certain way. The next level of sophistication is brought by **business alerts**:
    in this case, diagnostic checks are carried out automatically and users get notified
    when some situation of business interest (like the market share for a brand going
    below a certain threshold) arises. Similarly, in the case of **anomaly detection**,
    algorithms continuously inspect data to find any inconsistency in patterns and
    flag it as such, so it can be managed accordingly: for instance, the data generated
    by sensors in a production line can be used to spot malfunctions early on and
    trigger the required maintenance. Predictive analytics also includes methods that
    anticipate the future by generating *forecasts* of measures, such as sales, price,
    market size, and level of risk, all of which can certainly help managers make
    better decisions and prepare for what''s about to come. Also, the behavior of
    individual entities like consumers and competitors can be forecasted, producing
    a competitive advantage and an improved **Return on Investment** (**ROI**) of
    forthcoming activities. In the case of **propensity models**, AI is leveraged
    to predict how much a customer is going to like a commercial offer, or how likely
    are they to leave our store or service (churn), enabling us to finetune our retention
    activities. One last example of predictive analytics is when we use data and algorithms
    to create smart *segmentations* of our business, like when we''re grouping together
    similar customers, stores, or products. By tailoring the way we manage them, we
    can make our operations more efficient and the experience of our customers more
    personalized and engaging.'

    by answering the ultimate question every business manager has: "what should be
    done?". If descriptive and predictive analytics produces insights and informs
    us about our business, prescriptive analytics is certainly more assertive and
    direct: it tells us what to do. For example, it can simulate a large set of alternative
    scenarios and implement a **systematic optimization** across them: the output
    would be the "best recipe" to follow to maximize profit or minimize cost, given
    the current conditions. Other examples of prescriptive analytics are the so-called
    **recommendation systems**: essentially, they provide users with recommendations
    on products. These algorithms are virtually omnipresent in our everyday digital
    experience. When we shop around on Amazon or struggle to pick which TV series
    to binge watch next on Netflix, we are going to be presented with the output of
    some recommendation systems, offering us a limited number of options we are likely
    going to like. The ultimate level of sophistication comes when prescriptive analytics
    is not only recommending what to do but is in charge of doing it! In fact, when
    they are run in real time, no human being might be able to fully control and explicitly
    approve every decision or recommendation that the machine has come up with. In
    some cases, algorithms are designed to behave like **autonomous agents**: these
    are in charge of learning through an iterative **trial and error** process. They
    will continuously test their strategy in the real world and correct it as necessary,
    with the ultimate objective of maximizing returns in the long term. This is what
    happens, for instance, with automated trading (a rising trend in FinTech) and
    programmatic advertising (which is the real-time buying of digital media through
    automatic bids).'

    cover an acceptable range of needs: they form our **data analytics toolbox**.
    By learning how to use and how to effectively combine the few tools we have put
    in the toolbox, we can become autonomous data analytics practitioners. Like a
    plumber would have his or her preferences on the instruments to use, you will
    also have your own predilections and can customize your toolbox to your personal
    tastes. You just want to ensure you pick the right mix of tool types, so that
    you have a broad range of functionalities readily available to you.'

    able to open a *Microsoft Excel* file (or its open source alternative, *OpenOffice
    Calc*, or a cloud-based service such as *Google Sheets*) and add simple formula
    calculations to it. They can also be very helpful when creating simple, one-off
    data visualizations: their level of graphic customization is good enough for many
    day-to-day data presentation needs. On the other side, spreadsheet software is
    inadequate for creating robust and automated data workflows: refreshing even a
    simple report created in Excel requires manual steps and is prone to human error.'

    efficient analytics solutions. These can then be embedded in real-time applications

    from. Actually, it''s quite the opposite – they have complementary strengths and
    weaknesses, and gracefully integrate into one another. Let''s consider an example:
    Laura is a supply chain data analyst working for a car manufacturer. She needs
    to quickly put together a capability that''s able to forecast the future demand
    for parts at the production line level, and then make results available to a number
    of purchasing analysts and plant managers across the globe. Laura decides to build
    a workflow in KNIME that pulls historical demand levels from a few corporate databases
    and combines it with inventory actuals. After an initial exploration phase, Laura
    builds a predictive model of demand using KNIME''s native functionalities and
    – later – optimizes it by adding some custom line of Python code directly into
    KNIME. After that, Laura completes her workflow with the last clean-up steps and
    exports the forecast results directly into a Power BI dataset. Lastly, Laura builds
    a simple dashboard made of a few tables and simple line charts in Power BI that
    enable end users to explore the data, filter it to their area of interest, and
    export it into a handy Excel file for further analysis and sharing.'

    used her whole analytics toolbox made of KNIME, Power BI, and a little bit of
    Python. She skillfully picked which tool to use by leveraging their strengths
    and fitting them to her specific needs. Without a versatile toolbox at hand, Laura
    would have struggled to meet the stringent timing requirement that her business
    case required.

    of a selection of tools that work very well together: KNIME and Power BI. These
    tools are quite powerful for multiple reasons. First of all, they can be downloaded
    and installed on your computer for free. Although both also offer a paid version,
    you will often find that the freely available versions provide plenty of functionality
    for the vast majority of your regular needs. The other advantage is that neither
    of them strictly requires any coding. This means that you can fully benefit from
    this toolkit without necessarily having to become a proficient Python or R programmer,
    making it a suitable kit for every professional who uses data, not just expert
    data scientists. For those who, instead, know how to program, this kit can be
    expanded further by integrating snippets of code, like Laura did in her project.
    Lastly, KNIME and Power BI are particularly well-suited to each other. If you

    will make a difference only when it finally drives some action that positively
    impacts the business. The bad news is that driving actions might be quite complex
    and often more difficult than building a powerful data capability. The good news
    is that we have not just one but multiple ways to impact the business with analytics:
    we call them **data-to-value paths**. It''s important to have them clear in our
    mind before we start working on data, so that we can maximize the business relevance

    or to shed light on a unique opportunity or threat. This is the most time-consuming
    path to follow, as it certainly requires a lot of human interaction, but can also
    be extremely rewarding. By means of data exploration and, if necessary, leveraging
    some predictive algorithms, you start your path by identifying an insight hidden
    in the data. To maximize its chance of impact, you then build an engaging story
    that is able to bring decision makers onboard with you and willing to make the
    right decision. Only when (and if) this decision comes to life and gets transformed
    into action will you be in the position of claiming economic value thanks to data
    analytics. Many insightful data discoveries were never implemented because some
    steps along this path failed. Sometimes, the story is not well-prepared and delivered,
    making a good recommendation unheard. In other cases, the data-based plans are
    not followed through because they were not well-explained or tracked. In the rest

    to make it to actual value.'

    By means of descriptive analytics and, when necessary, using some diagnostics
    algorithms, you make the data "speak loud and clear" through visuals and alerts.
    By enriching others through data analytics, you generate better actions and, so,
    add incremental value to the business. This data-to-value path might be less sophisticated
    than the others, but it carries a large potential for value creation as it can
    impact the work of many people and in a continuous manner. Later in this book,

    We glimpsed at the complexity of the full technology stack required for analytics
    to work: specifically, we went through the tools that data analytics practitioners
    should keep handy in their toolbox, spotting the value of the KNIME/Power BI couple.
