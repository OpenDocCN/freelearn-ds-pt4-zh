    it''s finally time to roll up our sleeves and make it happen. In this chapter,
    we are going to experience what it means to apply machine learning to tangible
    cases by going through a few step-by-step tutorials. Our companion KNIME is back
    on stage: we will learn how to build workflows for implementing machine learning
    models using real-world data. We are going to meet a few specific algorithms and
    learn the intuitive mechanisms behind how they operate. We''ll glimpse into their
    underlying mathematical models, focusing on the basics to comprehend their results
    and leverage them in our work.'

    agent based in Rome, Italy. The company you work for owns multiple agencies specialized
    in rentals of properties located in the broader metropolitan area of the Eternal
    City. Your passion for data analytics got you noticed by the CEO: she asked you
    to figure out a way to support agents in objectively evaluating the fair monthly
    rent of a property based on its features. She noticed that the business greatly
    suffers when the rent set for a property is not aligned with the market. In fact,
    if the rent is too low, the agency fee (which is a fixed percentage of the agreed
    rent) will end up being lower than what it could have been, leaving profit on
    the table. On the other hand, if the ask is too high, revenues for the agency
    will take longer to materialize, causing a substantial impact on the cash flow.
    The traditional approach to set the monthly rent for new properties is a "negotiation"
    between owners and agents, who will use their market understanding (and sometimes
    the benchmark of similar properties) to convince the owners about the right rent
    to ask for.'

    for training (which is a fair thing to do since, as anticipated in *Chapter 4*,
    *What is Machine Learning?*, the training set should normally cover between 70%
    and 80% of the total full dataset). We want the partitioning to happen randomly.

    display an unbalanced distribution across their values. This means that we have
    the risk of having the very few properties in a smaller neighborhood (like the
    26 rows referring to `Magliana`) ending up solely in a partition. Although this
    is not strictly required, we better avoid any unbalance that can affect our learning
    and select **Stratified sampling** on *Neighborhood* in the dialog. You can also

    `0`, depending on the category: for a given row, only one dummy variable will

    contacted customers (19% of the total) signed up for a new account. However, the
    calculation of the **Return On Investment** (**ROI**) pulled the entire audience
    back to the unsettling reality. The average cost of attempting to contact a customer
    through a call center is $15 per person while the incremental revenue resulting
    from a confirmed sale is estimated to be, on average, $60\. The math is simple:
    the pilot telemarketing campaign cost $150,000 and generated revenues amounting

    intuition: the option on the right (the split by *Type*) is "purer" as demonstrated
    by the lower Gini index. Now you have all the elements to see how the decision
    tree learning algorithm works: it will iteratively calculate the average *I*[G]
    for all possible splits (at least one for each available feature), pick the one
    with the lowest index, and repeat the same at the levels below, for all possible
    branches, until it is not possible to split further. In the end, the leaves are
    assigned by just looking at where the majority of the known examples fall. For
    instance, take the branching on the right in *Figure 5.21*: if this was the last
    level of a tree, kids will be classified with soda, couples with wine, and groups
    with beer. You can see in *Figure 5.22* the resulting full decision tree you would

    further split by *Menu*, so the tree just stops there. On top of this basic stopping
    criterion, you can implement additional (and more stringent) conditions that limit
    the growth of the tree by removing less meaningful branches: these are called—quite

    In the fast-food example, we only had nominal features, which make every split
    quite simple to imagine: every underlying branch covered a possible value of the
    categorical column. If you have a numeric column to be considered, the algorithm
    will check what the Gini index would be if you split your samples using a numeric
    threshold. The algorithm will try multiple thresholds and pick the best split
    that minimizes impurity. Let''s imagine that in our example we had an additional
    feature, called *Size*, that counts the number of people sitting at each table.
    The algorithm will test multiple thresholds and will check what the Gini index
    would be if you divided your samples according to these conditions, which are
    questions like "is *Size* > 3?", "is *Size* > 5?", and "is *Size* > 7?". If one
    of these conditions is meaningful, the split will be made according to the numeric
    variable: all samples having *Size* lower than the threshold will go to the left
    branch, and all others to the right branch. The Gini indices resulting from all
    the thresholds on the numeric features will be compared across all other indices
    coming from the categorical variables as we saw earlier: at each step, the purest
    split will win, irrespectively of its type. This is how decision trees can cleverly
    mix all types of features when classifying samples.'

    right side of *Figure 5.42*. As part of the first iteration, the algorithm will

    a more human-friendly way. As we look at it together with the CRM manager, we
    notice some initial clear patterns. For example, look at the chart at the top-right
    corner of *Figure 5.54*, which shows *Average Price* on the vertical axis and
    *Unique Products* on the horizontal axis. The blue cluster (cluster_0) clearly
    dominates the right-hand side of the chart, confirming that this is the segment
    of consumers that tend to try a more diverse set of products (high values of *Unique
    Products*). At the same time, the orange cluster (cluster_1) has customers that
    seem to go for less unique products and lower prices. Instead, the green cluster
    (cluster_2) includes those willing to pay more premium prices when shopping at
    our website. This is all starting to make sense, and the visual is already a big
    help in understanding how our clustering worked.
