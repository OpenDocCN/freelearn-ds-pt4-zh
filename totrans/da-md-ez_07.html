			<p class="normal"><em class="italic">A chart is worth a thousand words</em>, goes the old adage. Visual representation is often the preferred way to communicate numbers. As you can surely validate with your own experience, data charts are ubiquitous in business memos and presentations, as well as in newspaper articles and scientific papers. However, moving from data stored in a table to its graphic representation (a process called <strong class="keyword">data visualization</strong>) is far from being trivial and risk-free. Although many software packages (including Power BI, Excel, KNIME, and so on) provide rapid ways to build charts in a matter of seconds, making effective and professional-looking visuals is far from being easy: it requires structured planning and disciplined execution.</p>
			<p class="normal">This chapter will give you a set of practical guidelines to ensure that your business messages are communicated clearly through an effective data visualization process. In particular, we will go through the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">What types of charts are available, and what are their peculiarities?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Which chart should I use, considering the specific message I want to give?</li>
				<li class="bullet">How do I ensure that visuals are immediate and less prone to misunderstandings?</li>
				<li class="bullet">What are the common pitfalls to avoid when visualizing data?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">While in the previous chapter we focused on Power BI, in this one, we will acquire techniques that work well with <em class="italic">any</em> software able to produce visuals: in fact, think of data visualization as a tool-agnostic skill that you need to have in your data analytics practitioner's backpack.</p>
			<p class="normal">The flow of this chapter goes along the two essential phases of data visualization. The first step is to plan for our chart, considering the specific point we want to make and the chart types best serving our needs. Then, we move to build the chart, which includes finetuning the visual attributes, polishing the various graphical elements, and avoiding common mistakes: this part will be summarized into a practical list of data visualization quality rules to follow. Before getting into the planning step, let's quickly frame the ever-present need for visualizing data.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-122" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>What is data visualization?</h1>
			<p class="normal">Although the general concept of data visualization is straightforward, let's take some time to set <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>the scene properly. The essential objective of data visualization is to transfer a message made of data to another human being. Being effective at this communication process implies that the receiver comprehends the original data-based message and "makes sense" of it through cognition. <em class="italic">Figure 7.1</em> shows a graphical representation of a bad attempt of communicating data messages: presenting it all in its original format:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_01.png" alt="Text&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.1: Presenting data in its original format: as you can see, the decision-maker is visibly overwhelmed, and the large majority of the data is ignored</p>
			<p class="normal">The decision-maker here is clearly overwhelmed by such a large amount of raw data being offered. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>understandable: every human being has a limited amount of cognitive capacity, and our brains can only process a certain quantity of information at once. If we try to present too much data altogether, we will cross the cognitive limit of the receiver, who will obtain a <a id="_idIndexMarker696"/>partial or distorted version of the original message. As a result, our initial point is either missed or—even worse—misunderstood. The bad news is that whoever we have in front of us, however wise and number savvy they are, will always have a pretty limited amount of information they can make sense of: the rest will be simply ignored.</p>
			<p class="normal">The other bad news is that if we have several people looking at the same data, their "takeaways" will diverge since their individual sensitivities will make them pay attention to different slices or aspects of <a id="_idIndexMarker697"/>the original data. The good news is that we have an established way to communicate data effectively to other human beings: transforming it into an abstract visualization that conveys the key aspects we want to transfer. This is what data visualization is all about.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer316" class="note">
					<p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Data visualization is powerful because it leverages one of the most developed functionalities of our entire brain: vision. As part of our natural evolution, humans have relied on our eyes to perform life-critical activities such as spotting food supplies and identifying critical threats. Consequently, our brains have consistently finetuned their visual excellence. As David Williams, Professor of Medical Optics at the University of Rochester, noticed, now more than 50 percent of the cortex (the brain's surface) is involved in processing visual information: this is more than all other four senses combined! The brain can quickly interpret images by spotting some critical properties (such as size, color, curvature, position, slope, and so on) that we instinctively notice without using any conscious effort. They are <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>called preattentive attributes, and we exploit them extensively in data visualization.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>, you find the potential usage of data visualization: by encoding data (even a large amount of it, properly filtered and aggregated) into graphical summaries, the cognitive capacity of the decision-maker is utilized at its best, and the received message is unequivocal:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.2: Presenting data through visualization: by applying the right design choices, the decision-maker can easily understand your message</p>
			<p class="normal">As shown in the picture, data visualization is like a customizable funnel that requires some tuning to work properly. In fact, there is no one single way to visualize the same data: by making <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>some design choices (the type of chart, the measures to encode graphically, the visual attributes, and so on), you can "tune" the funnel to make it best fit for reaching your precise communication objective. Your responsibility is to get this tuning right. It's important to notice that these design choices are not driven by mere aesthetic needs. Every visual pattern in a chart has a meaning and gets interpreted by our brain, which instinctively recognizes in it some visual clues (preattentive attributes). Every graphical element uses part of the cognitive capacity, so we will not use any visual clue unless it has a meaning in the context of our communication objective. As we will learn in depth later, the mantra in data visualization is <em class="italic">less is more</em>, and <em class="italic">minimalism</em> is undoubtedly the way to go.</p>
			<p class="normal">Although the analogy with the funnel is a coarse simplification of reality (data visualization is more than just "compressing" data), it depicts well the mindset I would recommend you keep when visualizing data. Remember this: to convert data into immediate, impactful, and unambiguous visuals, you will have to make the right <em class="italic">design</em> choices. You need to act as a designer would do. In this chapter, you will impersonate the "operator" of the funnel in the picture, the visual designer who decides how to represent the data depending on the specific message to be transferred. You will learn how to make the right design choices for your charts consistently.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now that the scene is set and your role as a visual designer is unveiled, let's move to the planning phase, during which we will make some critical design choices.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-123" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>A chart type for every message</h1>
			<p class="normal">The ultimate ambition that should lie behind every chart is to carry a precise data-based message. Unsurprisingly, the very <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>first thing we have to do when planning for a chart is to decide which specific message we want to give. You can think of this message as the answer to a certain business question, such as <em class="italic">is brand X growing its market share consistently?</em> or <em class="italic">how do revenues relate with the price of the service?</em>. Although business questions can be pretty ambiguous and multifaceted, in most cases, they fall within one of the following three types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Evolution</strong>: These questions deal with the development of quantities over time. If your business question contains words like <em class="italic">grow</em>, <em class="italic">decline</em>, <em class="italic">increase</em>, <em class="italic">decrease</em>, <em class="italic">accelerate</em>, <em class="italic">decelerate</em>, <em class="italic">fall behind</em>, <em class="italic">lag</em>, <em class="italic">overtake</em>, or <em class="italic">trend</em>, it will likely fall within the <strong class="keyword">Evolution</strong> type<a id="_idIndexMarker701"/><a id="_idIndexMarker702"/>. This is one of the most popular types of queries that data charts answer as the need to understand how business performance indicators are evolving is omnipresent.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Size</strong>: These questions enquire on the relative proportion of components to a whole (also called <strong class="keyword">Part-to-Whole</strong>) or the ranking across comparable quantities. The typical words you can find within this type are <em class="italic">drivers</em>, <em class="italic">drainers</em>, <em class="italic">high</em>, <em class="italic">low</em>, <em class="italic">top</em>, <em class="italic">bottom</em>, <em class="italic">biggest</em>, <em class="italic">smallest</em>, and—in general—all superlative adjectives ending in <em class="italic">-est</em>. Every time we are after a benchmark, ranking, comparison, or a drill-down into components, we ask ourselves size-related business questions.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Relation</strong>: This type of <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>question investigates mutual relationships across different measures. When we use words such as <em class="italic">relate</em> or <em class="italic">grow/decline together</em>, and, in general, when we inquire how one quantity changes <em class="italic">with respect to another quantity</em>, we fall within this bucket.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Table 7.1</em> provides a list of sample business questions included within each group. After going through it, think about some questions you have lately been involved with at work: chances are that you will find examples within each of the three buckets.</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Table 7.1: A few samples of business questions organized by type of message</p>
			<p class="normal">Identifying which type of business message you want to give is a necessary initial step for planning your data visualization design. In fact, every type of message (Evolution, Size, or Relation) corresponds <a id="_idIndexMarker704"/>to one or more matching chart types, as <em class="italic">Figure 7.3</em> shows. In the figure, every row indicates a fundamental chart type (<strong class="keyword">Bar chart</strong>, <strong class="keyword">Line chart</strong>, <strong class="keyword">Treemap</strong>, and <strong class="keyword">Scatterplot</strong>): they come with a set of alternative renderings that you might consider using depending on the specific case:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.3: Chart selection matrix: every message type has its preferred chart type. Two stars are no-brainer matches, but one-star combinations can work well too</p>
			<p class="normal">I hope you find the chart selection matrix simple and easy to memorize, as it can be your best friend <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>in deciding quickly what type of chart to use depending on the message you want to give (and, by doing so, responding to the business question you had). You should consider that there are many more chart types available out there, some of them coming with great visual appeal: however, over 90% of the time, you will be able to convey clear messages by just using this minimal list of established chart types. Another advantage of sticking to the marked path is that your business partners naturally recognize these charts and know how to interpret them, making your message—remember what the ultimate objective of data visualization is—crisper and more direct.</p>
			<p class="normal">Having introduced the four chart types and when to choose them, let's go through each type and how it can be used optimally. For each chart type, you will find a summary description of what it is, some visual examples, and a series of rules (which you will see highlighted in bold) to keep handy when building that kind of chart.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-124" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Bar charts</h2>
			<p class="normal">Bar charts (<em class="italic">Figure 7.4</em>) are possibly the most iconic data chart type on earth. For each category represented on <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>the horizontal axis, you have one or multiple bars whose length is proportional to the quantity you want to visualize. Length is a very immediate preattentive attribute: the brain will naturally appreciate the differences <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>in relative size across each bar. This makes bar charts particularly well fitted to transfer messages <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>related to different sizes across business entities (such as brands, products, or countries), allowing a quick comparison, ranking, and benchmarking (especially when bars are sorted by height, which is normally recommended). Categories can also be time periods, like months, quarters, or years: this is why bar charts are used for driving messages regarding the evolution over time, too (of course, in this case, you should never sort the bars and always keep the natural time order):</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.4: A bar chart, in all its simplicity: you can easily compare GDP levels across countries at the first glance</p>
			<p class="normal">One simple rule to keep in mind when using bar charts is that the <strong class="keyword">scale should always start from zero</strong>. If we do <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>not do so, their length is not proportional to the actual value we want to display: we will be tricking the viewer's eye, misusing the preattentive attribute of length. For example, look at <em class="italic">Figure 7.5</em>: Germany's GDP per capita looks like half of Norway's, when it is actually around two-thirds of it:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.5: In bar charts, the bars should always start from zero (not from 25 like in this case)</p>
			<p class="normal">One interesting variation of this type of chart is the <strong class="keyword">horizontal bar chart</strong>: oftentimes, horizontal bars are better than<a id="_idIndexMarker710"/> vertical ones, especially when there are many <a id="_idIndexMarker711"/>categories or their labels are long. Look at the example in <em class="italic">Figure 7.6</em>: the country names do <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>not need to be tilted (saving the reader a stiff neck), and the bars can be longer, which makes appreciating the differences across countries easier:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.6: Horizontal bar charts: a simple way to better use your visual space</p>
			<p class="normal">When you have another category variable to be encoded, you can use a <strong class="keyword">stacked bar chart</strong>. As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.7</em>, every subcategory (in this case, the sector within the country) is displayed as a<a id="_idIndexMarker713"/> portion of the <a id="_idIndexMarker714"/>chart, highlighted with a different color. By doing so, you will show the size of each component relative to the whole bar, and you also enable comparisons across country/sector combinations. The advice is to <a id="_idIndexMarker715"/>use this only when there are few subcategories to be encoded (ideally no more than four); otherwise, it gets confusing for the reader to identify each bar portion:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_07.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.7: A stacked bar chart: you can distinguish subcategories through the use of color</p>
			<p class="normal">Another extension <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>within the bar chart family to consider is the <strong class="keyword">histogram</strong>:<strong class="keyword"> </strong>this is essentially <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>a bar chart showing the frequency distribution of a population by binned ranges. Have a look at the example in <em class="italic">Figure 7.8</em>. This chart tells us that the prices falling within the €5.8 to €5.9 bucket are the most frequent:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_08.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.8: A histogram: you can easily see the frequency of values falling within equally-sized ranges</p>
			<p class="normal">Lastly, another <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>useful variation of bar charts is <strong class="keyword">waterfall charts</strong>. These are great<a id="_idIndexMarker719"/> at unveiling the positive <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>and negative components in a before/after comparison, like the change in GDP that you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 7.9</em>:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_09.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.9: A waterfall chart: you can unveil the drivers and the drainers of a change</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Line charts</h2>
			<p class="normal">Line charts are the <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>most natural way to show the evolution of a quantity across a continuous variable, such as time. A typical case is the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.10</em>: the line is <a id="_idIndexMarker722"/>the result of "connecting the dots" among the different sales values shown on the vertical axis (which, in this case, does not need to start from zero like for bar charts) while on the horizontal axis you have the time values, organized in equally spaced intervals. The connecting lines between data points rely on the preattentive attribute of slope to carry your message of a quantity <em class="italic">going up or down</em> and at what speed:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_10.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.10: Anatomy of a line chart: the continuous variable (in most cases, time) is on the horizontal axis</p>
			<p class="normal">Although the most common case involves evolution over time, you can use line charts to plot the trend <a id="_idIndexMarker723"/>of any continuous variable. For instance, if you want to display the number of products sold at different price points, you can set the price on the horizontal axis and see how sales degrade as price increases. In any case, <strong class="keyword">never use categorical variables in the horizontal axis of a line chart</strong>. The reason is simple: in a line chart, the brain associates the slope<a id="_idIndexMarker724"/> of the line as the change between contiguous elements, like two subsequent points in time. Take <em class="italic">Figure 7.11</em>: there is no logical contiguity between Italy and Norway (besides alphabetical order, which is irrelevant to our message), so the steep increase we see between the two countries is both artificial and confusing:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_11.png" alt=""/> </figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.11: Categorical variables on the horizontal axis of a line chart: a beginner mistake to avoid</p>
			<p class="normal">You can also use line charts <a id="_idIndexMarker725"/>to show relationships across multiple time series evolving over the same time frame, and you can use colors to differentiate between lines. However, consider <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>using <strong class="keyword">direct labels</strong> placed right next to each line: these are clearer and avoid the use of legends, which saves the effort of "mapping" colors to categories. Additionally, this approach allows you to use colors to visually highlight part of the data like you find in <em class="italic">Figure 7.12</em>, which will make the chart more focused on the specific message you want to convey:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_12.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.12: A line chart with direct labels: avoid using color legends by replacing them with direct labels whenever possible</p>
			<p class="normal">One further piece of advice is to be very careful when adopting <strong class="keyword">dual axes</strong>, which means allowing lines in the same <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>chart to refer to two different references axes with different scales of measurement. One problem that can arise with dual axes is when the lines <a id="_idIndexMarker728"/>cross. Such a crossing is preemptively given attention by the brain of the reader: in other words, it <em class="italic">must signify something</em>. In reality, it might not have any meaning in relation to the message we want to give. Take the example of the left chart in <em class="italic">Figure 7.13</em>: the share and sales lines cross between Q2 and Q3, but this is solely due to the arbitrary <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>definition of the two vertical scales:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_13.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.13: Dual axis is tricky: the left chart has an artificial crossing point and it is harder to interpret than the right one</p>
			<p class="normal">The composition chart on the right in the figure is a more robust alternative: the bars and the line unambiguously <a id="_idIndexMarker730"/>refer to two different axes, which neither overlap nor generate any crossing. An additional reason to prefer the rendering on the right is its <strong class="keyword">simple axis increments</strong> for shares: the choice of having increments of two subsequent odd numbers (29%, 31%, 33%, and so on) is less immediate to follow than what we find on the right (with 30%, 35%, 40%, and so on).</p>
			<p class="normal">Another more<a id="_idIndexMarker731"/> straightforward alternative to visualize the same data is to visualize multiple lines in separate charts (generally called a trellis or panel chart), as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.14</em>. This approach is beneficial when trying to separate multiple overlapping data series. It is a way to <strong class="keyword">avoid spaghetti charts</strong>, where many lines are crammed into a single chart, making them hard to follow individually and decipher:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_14.png" alt="Chart, line chart&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.14: Two lines combined in a trellis chart: in this case, we avoid vertical axes by adopting data labels</p>
			<p class="normal">In the particular case of <em class="italic">Figure 7.14</em>, you can also see that the vertical axes have been completely removed and replaced by <strong class="keyword">data labels</strong> displaying the vertical axes values. When you prefer <a id="_idIndexMarker732"/>reporting precise values and do not have many data points to visualize, consider using data labels instead of relying on axes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Treemaps</h2>
			<p class="normal">Treemaps are great at displaying <a id="_idIndexMarker733"/>the relative size of the various components of a whole. In a treemap, the total space is split up into multiple rectangles, each one having a size that is <a id="_idIndexMarker734"/>proportional to a numerical variable. As you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 7.15</em>, multiple levels of a hierarchy (in this case, countries and categories are the two levels used for the breakdown of sales) can be displayed at once, and the size of all elements can be compared:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_15.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.15: A treemap for showing relative sizes of sales by country/category combinations: colors are used to highlight the prevalence of olive sales in each country</p>
			<p class="normal">Even when you have one single level <a id="_idIndexMarker735"/>of splits, treemaps offer a good way to convey the relative size of the parts of a whole. I bet that some of you are now thinking: <em class="italic">can't we use pie charts for that?</em> Although they are still widely used, data visualization specialists advise to <strong class="keyword">avoid pie charts</strong>, claiming that there are more immediate and better alternatives to adopt. Information design expert Stephen Few summarizes his sentiment toward pie charts with a straight rule: <em class="italic">Save the pies for dessert!</em> It is easy to see why: <em class="italic">Figure 7.16</em> shows a pie chart and a bar chart visualizing the same data set and clearly demonstrates why pie charts are inferior. Pies use angles to encode quantitative values. Angles are a much less immediate visual attribute to perceive than length, which is used in bar charts. Our brain struggles with evaluating the amplitude of angles. Look again at the pie chart displayed in the figure: can you easily compare the size of China (first slice of the pie, starting from "midday") with the one from France (the fourth slice, moving clockwise)?</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_16.png" alt="Chart&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.16: Pies are better used to accompany tea than to display data: in this case, the bar chart does a much better job</p>
			<p class="normal">The only situation when it is<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> acceptable to use pie charts (or their other sweet-sounding alternatives,<strong class="keyword"> donut charts</strong>) is when <a id="_idIndexMarker737"/>you have only two slices (as we did in the last chapter—see <em class="italic">Figure 6.32</em>): in this case, it is easy to see which part is bigger and it is OK to use these charts. In all other cases, you should use either bar charts or treemaps to transfer messages that deal with sizes and proportions: it's as simple as that.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Scatterplots</h2>
			<p class="normal">In scatterplots, data is displayed as a series of points on a rectangle. Two quantities are used to control <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>the horizontal <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>and vertical coordinates of the points appearing on the plot. In this way, you can easily show how the two quantities relate to each other. Have a look at the sample in <em class="italic">Figure 7.17</em>: the number of units sold (encoded as vertical coordinates, or <em class="italic">y</em>-axis) clearly goes down as the price per unit (used to control horizontal coordinates, or <em class="italic">x</em>-axis) increases:</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.17: A scatterplot showing the distribution of units sold in relation to the price per unit: the higher the price, the less we sell. The dotted trendline makes the relationship evident</p>
			<p class="normal">We can see a mutual interdependency of the two quantities (linear correlation): as price increases, we sell less. The scatterplot is giving us clear hints on non-linear phenomena as well. For example, in <em class="italic">Figure 7.17</em>, we can see that after the €6.00 threshold, there is an evident <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>deterioration of sales. It seems that the full digit price acts as a psychological threshold: customers <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>are attracted disproportionally more by a €5.99 price tag than by a €6.00 one. Linear and non-linear patterns like these can be easily spotted through scatterplots: this makes them a safe chart type choice when you need to convey a relationship-based business message.</p>

					<p class="Tip--PACKT-">Adding a <strong class="keyword">trendline</strong>, like the dotted one you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 7.17</em>, makes linear relationships stand out. Do you remember the linear regression algorithm we encountered in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Applying Machine Learning at Work?</em> The trendline is just the visual rendering of the linear model that explains the quantity on the vertical axis (dependent variable) through the quantity displayed on the horizontal axis (independent variable). You can go back to <em class="italic">Figure 5.7</em> for a visual refresher on linear regression.</p>

			<p class="normal"><strong class="keyword">Quadrant charts</strong>, like the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.18</em>, are interesting expansions to scatterplots. By means of two reference lines—one vertical and one horizontal—which usually are set to be in the "middle" of the range of interest, we cut the space of the plot into four quadrants. Every <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>quadrant relates to one of the four logical combinations of "being below" and "being above" each reference threshold:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_18.png" alt="Chart, scatter chart, bubble chart&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.18: A quadrant chart showing the market size and share change (x- and y-axis) and the magnitude of the business (size of the bubble): this chart offers a framework to classify each country depending on where it lies</p>
			<p class="normal">Such a chart becomes very powerful when you associate each quadrant with a clear business interpretation. For example, <em class="italic">Figure 7.18</em> shows the annual percentage change of a company's market share (vertical axis) and the market size where it operates (horizontal axis) by country. The countries appearing in the top-right corners (in our case, only India) are strengths: in these markets, the company is growing its share of the business, and also, the total consumption of the category is growing (maybe driven by population growth). If the trend is confirmed in the future, this market will become increasingly important to the company: combined with the growth of market share, India can be added to the list of the strategic <em class="italic">strengths</em> for the company. If you look instead at the bottom-right quadrant, we find countries where the market size is growing, but the share is declining. If we don't act, these markets will progressively hit more and more of our global share, as the country's footprint will likely increase. Thus, these are <em class="italic">threats</em> that need careful management attention. In this quadrant chart, the bubble's size is proportional to the magnitude of the current business, making it easier to see what the priorities are. This example illustrates the potential of quadrant charts to become <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>business-sound <strong class="keyword">interpretation frameworks</strong> for your data. Unfortunately, quadrant charts are still underutilized, and I strongly recommend thinking about possible applications in your work area, as they can make a real difference.</p>
			<p class="normal">One last consideration on scatterplots: the scales do not need to start from zero. Consequently, you <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>can use scatterplots in lieu of bar charts to convey size-related messages when the values you want to display are all far from "zero": this will give you a meaningful advantage in reducing the scale to a smaller range of interest, making differences more visible. For example, <em class="italic">Figure 7.19 </em>is a scatterplot showing the same data as <em class="italic">Figure 7.4</em>: in the scatterplot, the gaps in GDP per capita by country are even more apparent:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_19.png" alt="Chart, waterfall chart&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.19: A scatterplot alternative to the bar chart in Figure 7.4: if the message is about absolute distances of GDP per capita across countries, this design can work well</p>
			<p class="normal">We have now completed the tour through the fundamental types of charts available for your data visualization needs. Bar charts, line charts, treemaps, and scatterplots encompass the vast majority of the business messages you can convey through data. Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's pull them all together and finalize our visual design.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Finalizing your visual</h1>
			<p class="normal">On top of the specific <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>guidelines to follow for each type of chart, which we have encountered in the previous pages, there are some general quality design rules that apply every time. The common denominator of such rules brings us back to where we started at the beginning of the chapter: minimalism is the ultimate key to effective data visualization.</p>
			<p class="normal">Yale University professor Edward Tufte has been a pioneer in modern data visualization. One of the key concepts he introduced is the <strong class="keyword">data-ink ratio</strong>, which describes the prevalence of data-driven visual elements in a <a id="_idIndexMarker746"/>chart. Consider all the "ink" you use in a chart to draw the essential, non-redundant display of data information: if we erased these chart elements, we would also remove the underlying business message we wanted to convey. Now think about the total ink you would need to print the chart, which includes non-required legends, background pictures, unneeded text, and so on. Tufte found out that by removing all the clutter, we maximize the proportion of data-ink on the total ink (data-ink ratio), and, by doing so, we obtain more effective data visuals.</p>
			<p class="normal">Let's use an example to see how bad it can get: <em class="italic">Figure 7.20</em> shows a bad bar chart that features a collection of several wrong design choices:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_07_20.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.20: An example of what not to do when visualizing data: the data-ink ratio in this chart is at its lowest</p>
			<p class="normal">Although it is rare to find data visuals<a id="_idIndexMarker747"/> that are as bad as this one, I am sure that many of the visuals you see at work will carry one or more of the faults you see displayed there. In the following few pages, we will go through a practical set of guidelines we can follow to avoid all these issues. We need to train our design-critical eye to spot such shortcomings so that we can build neat and professional-grade data charts all the time. Looking at <em class="italic">Figure 7.20</em>, it seems that we are spoilt for choice on where to start from:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Gridlines</strong>: Gridlines can help guide the eye to connect data points with the axes, but they are not always necessary. In any case, they should always be visually muted and barely visible. Make them as thin as possible and color them with a light gray. Do not exaggerate <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>with the number of gridlines per axis: they should not be more than 10 per dimension. If you can avoid gridlines altogether, even better: for example, if you use data labels on top of your data points, you should definitely remove gridlines and axes as they are no longer needed.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Tick marks: </strong>Tick marks can help to align axis labels to data elements, like time periods, on a line chart. Similar to gridlines, tick marks should be visually muted, so keep them short and thin. Bar charts <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>do not generally need tick marks, as it should be easy to connect every bar to a category. Like for any visual aid, if you are unsure whether to keep them or not, my advice is to remove them and then check if everything is still clear.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Chart border</strong>: You can remove the external chart borders from your visuals: they consume ink but <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>certainly do not add any information. To avoid any mix-up with the rest of the elements or text in your slide or document, leave a generous stripe of white space around the chart: it will look tidy and light, which is what you need.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Rotated text</strong>: As discussed earlier, when text is vertically rotated or even tilted, it is less <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>accessible, takes extra time to read, and should be avoided. In the case of bar charts, use horizontal bars to gain space for lengthy labels. </li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">3D effects</strong>: A data chart is an <em class="italic">abstract </em>representation of a collection of data points. When it comes to data visualization, we can surely leave <em class="italic">realism </em>out of the picture. A three-dimensional perspective in a data chart can only harm as it makes it harder to <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>compare sizes and refer to reference lines. 3D scatterplots are sometimes used for exploring data in scientific contexts: in this case, they always allow the possibility to interact by rotating and panning the view appropriately. In business contexts, this is hardly needed. Don't use 3D.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Shadows</strong>: Similar to what we said for 3D, there is no reason to add an impression of light and <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>shadow in any data visualization. Although many software platforms allow—quite inexplicably—it, don't add shadows to your visuals.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Background</strong>: The background of your chart should be neutral so that everything that lies in the foreground stays as distinguishable as possible. Sometimes, inexperienced users add color or—even worse—pictures with products and brands in the background of charts to make them "cool": they just lower their chance of success in <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>delivering their business message as the chart is less readable. Funnily enough, Excel provides the option to add the white marble texture you see in <em class="italic">Figure 7.20</em> as a background —I haven't made it up! Don't ask me why, but Excel has also got a preloaded texture that features fish fossils. It is pretty bizarre, so check it out, but—please—never use it.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Labels</strong>: Using labels to identify lines or to specify data values can be very useful. You should avoid <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>duplications that will add non-data ink: if you have data labels on a line or bar chart, for instance, you can entirely remove axes and gridlines, as we did in <em class="italic">Figure 7.14</em>. When you use labels, make sure they don't have any border or non-neutral background. If they display data values, don't overdo it with decimal digits, like in <em class="italic">Figure 7.20</em>. In general, keep any text label as short as strictly required to deliver the message you need with clarity.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Legend</strong>: Legends are used to provide the key to interpret colors or textures in a chart. The problem with <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>using them is that they consistently require the eye and the attention of the reader to go back and forth between the data elements in the chart and the legend itself. As a general rule, we should try to avoid using them and always look for alternatives, like we did with direct labels in <em class="italic">Figure 7.12</em>. If you have to use them, try to limit the number of items by grouping elements together or filtering the unimportant ones: it is hard for the human eye to distinguish neatly between more than five colors in the same chart.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">On top of the preceding elements, when refining our data chart, we should pay attention to the use of color. It is important to recognize that color is one of the most immediate preattentive attributes that our brain decodes when presented with a chart. As for the other attributes, such as length, size, and position, colors should always have a specific meaning when used in a data chart. In other words, colors are never there for decoration or to please any aesthetic need. In data visualizations, colors are there for a functional reason, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Highlighting elements that deserve attention</strong>, like we did when emphasizing the olives category in <em class="italic">Figure 7.15</em>. As we will see in the next chapter, colors can be very powerful when diversifying between the back- and foreground when presenting data.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Encoding an extra dimension</strong>, like in the stacked bar chart shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.7</em>, or displaying continuous variables through color gradients.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer337" class="note">
					<p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Around 5% of people are affected <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>by <strong class="keyword">Color Vision Deficiency</strong> (<strong class="keyword">CVD</strong>), a form of color blindness that makes some combinations of colors (like shades of green and red) indistinguishable. Therefore, try to be fully inclusive in your data visuals by adopting colorblind-friendly palettes (<a href="http://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind"><span class="url">davidmathlogic.com/colorblind</span></a>) or by using light versus dark color differences (this is also useful when your charts are printed in black and white-only ink).</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-129" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="normal">This chapter has equipped you with a set of practical tools and guidelines for designing professional-looking and effective visuals to use in your daily work. We started our journey by framing the overall objective of visualizing data: transferring data-based messages to others by leveraging human visual perception. We have seen how we need to impersonate the role of a designer, who must make choices about what and how to visualize. After selecting the specific message type to give (which can be focused on evolution over time, making sense of absolute and relative size, or relation across quantities), we learned how to pick the right chart type using the chart selection matrix. We discovered pros and cons and typical pitfalls behind the implementation of line charts, bar charts, treemaps, and scatterplots, which collectively account for the vast majority of charts we need. Lastly, we went through a set of guidelines to adopt when ensuring the quality of any data visual. We discovered that all these rules have a common goal: they all invite us to apply methodical simplification, directness, and minimalism when building charts.</p>
			<p class="normal">All the good practices we have learned in this chapter require practice to turn into a habit. My advice is to apply all the rules we have learned here as soon as you put your hands on the next data chart you must refresh or create. Some of those rules might feel awkward at first—I know that there were some big fans of pie charts among you—but they will undoubtedly help you become more confident and successful at visualizing data.</p>
			<p class="normal">In this chapter, we focused on transforming data into visuals and conveying a specific message. In the next chapter, we will take this a step further: we will learn how to turn data-based messages into compelling stories, which is what data storytelling is all about.</p>
