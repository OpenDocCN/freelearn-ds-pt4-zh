			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130" class="chapterTitle" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Telling Stories with Data</h1>
			<p class="normal">This is the chapter you didn't expect. What can be analytical, scientific, and professional in producing and delivering a work of fiction? However paradoxical it might look, storytelling is one of the most pragmatic ways to create economic value out of data. In this chapter, you will learn how this works and how you can use it to your advantage.</p>
			<p class="normal">We will shortly answer the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">What have stories to do with business and data analytics?</li>
				<li class="bullet">What ingredients make a story?</li>
				<li class="bullet">How do I build one, starting from my data?</li>
				<li class="bullet">What techniques can I use to deliver stories that drive business value?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">In the first part of the chapter, you will discover what makes stories so effective at communicating with (and convincing) others. In the second part, you will learn a simple methodology and some practical tips to build powerful data stories yourself. This chapter is different from the others in the book as it aims at developing a much softer set of skills than what you have seen so far. For some of you who are more at ease with technology and science, this might feel slightly uncomfortable. In any case, I promise that it will be worth reading this chapter: you might become an unexpected data storytelling fan, like many others before you.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-131" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>The art of persuading others</h1>
			<p class="normal">Being right is not enough: this is the plain and sometimes upsetting reality faced by many data practitioners who cannot have their points—however truthful and insightful—heard and accepted by those in charge. As we saw in the first chapter, there are multiple routes for leveraging data analytics to create economic value, which we called data-to-value paths. In most cases, to create value, we need data to influence others to make the right decisions or take the appropriate actions. Think about this now: all you have seen so far in the book—all the efforts to transform your data, find insights, and build robust models—will sadly remain useless if we miss the last bit of the chain, which is impacting the actions of others. It is in our best interests to protect our work from becoming irrelevant by driving it all the way through to action, without making the naïve assumption that "it is enough to do the math work." To do so, we need to communicate our points convincingly, by mastering the art and science of persuasion.</p>
			<p class="normal">The simplest (and oldest) model that describes the dynamics of persuasion is <strong class="keyword">Rhetoric</strong>: it summarizes the three <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>essential features that make a speech or a written document (in our case, think about a presentation to support a management decision or a business memo) successful in convincing others. These features, also known as <strong class="keyword">Modes of Persuasion</strong>, are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Credibility</strong>: the authority and the personal integrity of the speaker, the authors, or the supporters of an argument will make it more credible and easier to be accepted. Those <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>who can boast a proven track record of success will have an easier job gaining approval. Also, the reliability of the sources used to support a point will undoubtedly strengthen a case.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Logical soundness</strong>: a clear and solid chain of rational arguments will engage with the intellect and the sense <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>of reason of the audience and result in higher acceptance. If you can <em class="italic">prove</em> your point using a logic that is accepted (and—notably—well understood) by others, they will ultimately buy into it. If your logic has any flaws or cannot be followed, your audience will call your entire case into question, even when you are totally right.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Emotional engagement</strong>: if an audience is emotionally invested and feels personally involved in your case, it is more likely that you will get them to agree and act upon what <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>you recommend. There are many ways to develop an emotional appeal, like using imagery that evokes feelings, choosing words with emotional emphasis, referring to first-hand experiences, drawing analogies that people can personally relate to, and creating gripping stories that keep attention high. This feature requires you to recognize emotions, discern feelings, and adjust your style and content <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>depending on the environment, a set of abilities called <strong class="keyword">Emotional Intelligence</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer340" class="note">
					<p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Rhetoric<a id="_idIndexMarker763"/> is an ancient discipline. It developed first in Sicily, in the Greek colonies of Syracuse and Agrigento in the 5th century BC, as a technical methodology to increase legal proceedings' chance of success. It was first described by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC), who came up with the 3-pillar<a id="_idIndexMarker764"/> model <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>presented <a id="_idIndexMarker766"/>here: <strong class="keyword">Ethos</strong> (ἦ<em class="italic">θος</em>, which stands for credibility), <strong class="keyword">Logos</strong> (<em class="italic">λόγος</em>,<em class="italic"> </em>logic), and <strong class="keyword">Pathos</strong> (<em class="italic">πάθος</em>, emotions).</p>

			<p class="normal">Let's go back <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>to business data and examine a few specific examples showing how we can use rhetoric to our advantage. <em class="italic">Table 8.1</em> reports only some of the techniques we <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>can implement in data rhetoric: as you go through it, think about the situations <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>where you have seen them already in action, and start imagining how <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>you can leverage them in your next data presentation:</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Table 8.1: Examples of data rhetoric in use</p>
			<p class="normal">Depending on your background, personal inclinations, and style, you might find each of the three modes of persuasion more or less natural for you to use. In general, we can observe some patterns in these preferences.</p>
			<p class="normal">For example, many data professionals would feel most comfortable with the logos mode: by applying scientific methodologies to the available data, they feel at ease proving their points with confidence. The world of data and logic is <em class="italic">their</em> world. </p>
			<p class="normal">Having a preference toward the ethos mode partly depends on the history of the individual presenter and the equity she or he has in the organization. Fortunately, the element of personal credibility can be worked upon and progressively built over time. </p>
			<p class="normal">The mode that is, for most data practitioners, the toughest to master is pathos. Emotions are harder to manage than numbers and algorithms. They fail to fall into static and pre-determined categories. A fascinating aspect of human beings is that they are all different, with each carrying distinctive levels of sensitivity. No doubt that managing the pathos mode when convincing others with data is the most arduous bit to handle, which will require extensive coverage in the remainder of this chapter.</p>
			<p class="normal">The good news is that there is a proven way to achieve high emotional engagement when making logical arguments with data, and this is what we are going to focus on now: building great stories.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>The power of telling stories </h1>
			<p class="normal">Humans are storytelling creatures. This condition is inherent to our nature. When our ancestors first gathered together around a campfire, stories started to be told, and language developed accordingly. The vital purpose of storytelling has always been to transfer knowledge so that it can <em class="italic">stick</em> in the minds of listeners and persuade them. Since the dawn of humanity, culture has been transmitted through stories: they were passed down through generations verbally, well before writing (and PowerPoint presentations) existed.</p>
			<p class="normal">Nowadays, our daily life is utterly immersed in stories. Brands communicate through narratives: commercials will urge you to buy a product through a story instead of merely enumerating the reasons why you should do so. What do you do when you chat with a good friend or meet<a id="_idIndexMarker771"/> a colleague by the coffee machine? You will tell stories about your life rather than making a cold inventory of your past activities. And when you consume media at home, read a book, watch a play, or put your children to bed, you are taking advantage of the natural attraction to fictional stories that unite us all.</p>
			<p class="normal">Out of the many causes that make stories so central to our life in general, there are three <a id="_idIndexMarker772"/>specific reasons why storytelling works so well when presenting data in a business context:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbered"><strong class="keyword">Stories stick more than statistics</strong>. Multiple cognitive psychology studies confirm that facts will stick in our brain much better when connected in a narrative than when they are separate. As a famous experiment by Stanford professors Gordon Bower and Michal Clark proved, people can remember a list of random words 6 to 7 times better if they are memorized by creating a fictional story that includes them. Other studies demonstrated that narrative texts could be read twice as fast and recalled twice as well compared to expository texts. By just adding a plot that "connect the dots" across facts, you are more likely to be understood and remembered: it is as simple as that.</li>
				<li class="numbered"><strong class="keyword">Stories encourage acceptance</strong>. When we watch a sci-fi series, we know perfectly well that it is only a work of fiction and none of it is real. Yet we might be captivated by it and we keep watching it, moving greedily to the next episode. How is that possible? This happens because when we are in front of a story, we tacitly sign an agreement called the <strong class="keyword">Narrative Pact</strong>. It reads something along the lines of: "I agree <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>to momentarily suspend my disbelief as I know that something good will come out from this story, either in terms of new knowledge or experience" (such as entertainment or a momentary disconnection from reality). When somebody is telling us a story, we agree to concede the benefit of the doubt as we accept the prospect of being surprised (and even change our mind). Many business situations will require you to move your audience out of their current beliefs, so the narrative pact is exactly what you need! A large majority of decision-making is driven by gut feel and earlier personal experiences. When you begin telling a story, you get your audience to implicitly sign a narrative pact, and this is an excellent way to get open-minded listening from them.<div id="_idContainer341" class="packt_tip"><p class="Tip--PACKT-">As fiction writers know well, the narrative pact works only if we offer coherent logic throughout our fictional world. As we will see later in the chapter, we will have to keep consistency across our data story in terms of content (underlying assumptions, use of words) and appearance (like colors and formats).</p></div></li>
				<li class="numbered"><strong class="keyword">Stories drive connection</strong>. When Princeton neuroscientist Uri Hasson used fMRI scanners to study the brain activity of storytellers and their listeners, he was surprised by the results: as stories unfolded, the subjects' brains started to become aligned, showing signals with increasingly synchronized patterns. Stories have the power to create a state of emotional connection, or empathy, between <a id="_idIndexMarker774"/>the parts involved. This connection will get your audience to feel closer to you and identify with you. As a result, they will be more prone to agree with what your data suggests.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="normal">All we've seen in the last few pages leads us to a simple conclusion: stories add wheels to our data insights, making them go faster and further. Our points will be more memorable and easier to accept by equipping our data with an engaging narrative. Storytelling is an effective vehicle for taking our precious insights to where it matters: the decision makers' capacity to act, to change things, and, by doing so, to turn data into real business value. Having seen <em class="italic">why</em> storytelling is such an important skill to have, let's look at how we can put it into action with our data.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-133" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>The data storytelling process</h1>
			<p class="normal">Crafting an engaging data story requires mixing the exercise of creativity with the application of a structured <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>methodology. In the following pages, we will uncover each step of the <strong class="keyword">Data Storytelling Process</strong>, a <em class="italic">recipe</em> you can follow when looking for the right way to influence your business partners through data and analytics. This is how it works:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbered" value="1">The first step is to <strong class="keyword">Set the Objectives</strong>, which means defining your story's expected outcome (anticipating what it will cause) and getting clarity on your audience composition, drivers, and previous knowledge.</li>
				<li class="numbered">Then you <strong class="keyword">Select the Scenes</strong> your story will be made of and you draft them. We will go through five archetypal scene types you can use as an inspiration for your data to speak up.</li>
				<li class="numbered">Once you are clear on the scenes, you sequence them and <strong class="keyword">Apply the Structure</strong> that will make your story flow well. We will introduce a basic 3-act structure that proves to be a good base for organizing your narrative.</li>
				<li class="numbered">At this point, you will <strong class="keyword">Polish the Scenes</strong> to make their content stand out: you will be clear on what should be in the background and what deserves instead to be well lit in the foreground of each scene.</li>
				<li class="numbered">Your draft can go through several cycles where you progressively <strong class="keyword">Refine</strong> it, reconsidering <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>all scenes and their structure, to make sure you are ultimately meeting your original business objectives.</li>
				<li class="numbered">Your story will finally be ready for prime time, and you will feel confident to <strong class="keyword">Deliver</strong> it in front of your audience.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure 8.1</em> shows a graphical summary of the data storytelling process: you define your objectives, then you go through an iterative process of picking, structuring, and polishing your scenes, and then you are ready to deliver:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_08_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.1: The data storytelling process: define objectives, refine your set of scenes, and deliver confidently</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer343" class="packt_tip">
					<p class="Tip--PACKT-">Building a powerful data story and preparing for its delivery takes time! You should proactively plan for it: if possible, block some slots in your calendar and allow quality time for rehearsals before your prime time.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal">Let's start from the first part of the process: defining your story objectives.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Setting objectives</h2>
			<p class="normal">An essential condition to reach any goal is to be clear on what it looks like. The same applies to <a id="_idIndexMarker777"/>data storytelling: the initial step of the process is to clarify to yourself what you want to obtain and from whom you will obtain it.</p>
			<p class="normal">Think about the precise outcome that you are after and try to see in your mind's eye a vivid picture <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>of what it would look like to be successful:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">Do you want to make somebody aware of some insightful data findings? By the end of your delivery, they should look convinced about your discovery and what it implicates.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Are you trying to secure some funding for a project or extra investment for your team? The outcome you want to reach is that your decision-maker approves it right after listening to your story.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Have you unveiled a business opportunity and want to convince a manager about the solution that you found? Your objective is to get the manager to feel uneasy about the current status quo and support your recommendation with a high sense of urgency.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">These examples are a bit stereotypical and clichéd: in real business contexts, your objective will be a combination of multiple items. Still, before you start working on your story, you want to be as clear as possible on the specific scenario you want to make happen. Make a written note of it, as you will use it to check your story's validity at the end. </p>
			<p class="normal">Storytelling always involves an audience, and its features will dictate the way you build a story and bring it to life. We cannot ignore the audience and—actually—the more we tailor our story to them, the more effective we will be in reaching our objective. In this initial phase, you want to focus your mind on two fundamental characteristics that define who you have in front of you, namely:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="alphabetic-l2"><strong class="keyword">Current knowledge and prior beliefs</strong>: What can you reasonably assume they already know about the topic you will talk to them about? What background will they need to be able to follow you? Are they equipped to understand you when you explain the methodology you used to analyze and model your data? What are their existing beliefs on the matter of your story? Is there any convincing needed to steer them away from any pre-existing wrong assumptions? Take a few minutes to think through these points—maybe with the help of others who know them best—and take note of the no-miss items your content should include. By thinking through these points, you will also anticipate some of the questions from your audience and proactively get ready to answer them.</li>
				<li class="alphabetic-l2"><strong class="keyword">Key business goals</strong>: What does your audience really care the most about? What specific business measures are currently at the front of their minds? What are their strategic priorities right now? For example, is it more important to expand the business quickly in other markets or beat the competition in the current ones? Growing sales or driving productivity through savings? You want to have a clear idea of what business KPIs they care about the most so that you can share your findings and <a id="_idIndexMarker779"/>proposals in terms of those. Don't underestimate the importance of being aligned with what matters to your audience when speaking to them: many data stories go unheard because presenters are unable to appeal to their listeners. You want to talk the same language and pull the right strings.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="normal">Having a vivid picture in your mind of the desired outcome and understanding your audience's current knowledge and motives will help you stay relevant, intriguing, and focused on results: this is the best vantage point from which you can start building a great data story.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Selecting scenes</h2>
			<p class="normal">As we are talking about stories, I am sure it will not surprise you if we borrow some nomenclature typical of theater and filmmaking industries such as <em class="italic">scenes</em> and <em class="italic">acts</em>. In theater plays, scene refers <a id="_idIndexMarker780"/>to the actions that happen in a specific place at one time. In data storytelling, a scene represents a precise statement, supported by specific data findings. Scenes can be summarized in a succinct and crisp phrase, such as: <em class="italic">sales have been eroding as of last September by 8% every month</em> or <em class="italic">by launching this new service now, we can expect to break even within less than 2 years</em>. Scenes are the fundamental components of your story, the individual rings constituting the chain of your narrative: they have to be self-standing (solidly backed by data) and crisp to firmly guide the audience through the development of your logical arguments.</p>
			<p class="normal">It is hard to pinpoint the right set of scenes to make a data story. If you have large quantities of data, you might fall into the temptation of showing more of it than necessary, including data that does not support your plot's unfolding. You might end up showing a mass download of data points without any clear findings or connections between them: by doing so, you will cause your audience to become very confused. On the other hand, if you don't have enough data evidence to support a scene, the fundamentals of your story will crumble, the narrative chain will be broken, and the logical soundness of your argument will fall apart. Moreover, a data scene must tell us something attractive, valuable, and functional to the story's development. If we show some data without clarifying why it is important, we lose the audience's engagement.</p>
			<p class="normal">The risk of getting lost in the tricky—and many—paths data can offer is high. Fortunately, we can recognize several recurrent types of relevant data scenes: they work well as turning points <a id="_idIndexMarker781"/>in a story and can provide interesting <em class="italic">twists</em> to the narrative. Having them clear in our minds can help us define our story's scenes, which is exactly what we need to do as part of the process. The five most common <strong class="keyword">Data Scene Types</strong> are evolution, comparison, relationship, breakdown, and distribution. We will now go through each of them, clarifying the typical data evidence you should use to support the specific point you want to make and provide examples.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-136" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Evolution</h3>
			<p class="normal">This scene is all about <a id="_idIndexMarker782"/>highlighting some sort of change over time. The typical case is to feature growing or declining KPIs (<em class="italic">over the past 5 years, revenues have steadily grown by 7% year on year, accelerating in the last 3 months</em>; <em class="italic">in December, we experienced a 13% drop in the number of users versus November</em>): this tells a lot about the dynamic state of a business. Analyzing the past evolution of a metric can highlight trend-breakers and relevant "exceptions" (<em class="italic">during the campaign, we had 2.5x more visitors on our website than in an average day</em>). It can also show repeating patterns and cycles, unveiling seasonal components in the way our business runs (<em class="italic">the consumption of hot chocolate between December and February usually accounts for two-thirds of the yearly category sales</em>). Using predictive models, our scene can also focus on anticipating what may occur in the future, alerting the audience about what is to come (<em class="italic">next year we expect a 15% drop in the number of monthly new contracts, which accounts for $2.5M</em>).</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-137" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Comparison</h3>
			<p class="normal">You use this scene type when you take your audience through the result of a side-by-side comparison <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>across two or more items: this is very powerful when you want to magnify significant differences (<em class="italic">for our dealership, selling a car of maker A is 3.4x and 3.7x more profitable than when selling a car of maker B and C, respectively</em>) or report differential results of what-if simulations (<em class="italic">option A ensures €4.5k incremental sales every week compared with option B</em>). This scene is ubiquitous in a data story: often, you want to use the contrast effect to enhance differences and direct your story in a specific direction.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer344" class="packt_tip">
					<p class="Tip--PACKT-">You will make your data story more impactful if you convey your key scenes in business-relevant terms. In comparison scenes, try to "monetize" the gap by converting it to the same unit of measure your audience is evaluated on (like dollar sales, number of new subscribers, or percentage points of cost reduction).</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-138" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Relationship</h3>
			<p class="normal">By using this scene type, you show how two measures are related to each other. A common situation <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>is when you highlight the degree to which two quantities move in relation to each other. You can summarize this relationship using a correlation coefficient (<em class="italic">the 85% of the variability in the sales of ice creams can be explained by weather conditions</em>) or the parameters of a model that fits them (<em class="italic">for every dollar of price increase, we expect a 12 point decrease in market share</em>).</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer345" class="packt_tip">
					<p class="Tip--PACKT-">Although relationship scenes are used to suggest a cause-effect relationship across business KPIs, it will be your job to discriminate between correlation and causality links, making the difference crystal clear to your audience. Make sure to explicitly mention what the relationship you unveiled does <em class="italic">not</em> infer, ideally by proposing some counterfactuals. By doing so, you will prevent your story from being misinterpreted and damaging the business.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal">Another case (in partial overlap with the evolution scene type) is when you show an intersection in the progression of two metrics, flagging the point in time when one measure surpasses the other (<em class="italic">as of last year, manufacturer A has taken over manufacturer B and become the market leader</em>) or making considerations about the gap that is progressively building up across the two (<em class="italic">manufacturer A is now shipping twice as many bikes than manufacturer B every month</em>).</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-139" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Breakdown</h3>
			<p class="normal">You use this scene when you break something into its components. For example, you can drill down <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>into a more granular view to show what are the main drivers (or drainers) of a business metric (<em class="italic">out of the current $10.4M gap versus target, $9.2M is solely due to product X</em>, <em class="italic">83% of our Europe earnings are generated in Italy while the remainder is equally split by Spain and Greece</em>): this is very powerful when you want to steer the attention of your audience to the (few) components that matter the most. You can also go the other way around and "zoom out" from a detailed view to an aggregated one to offer a comparison with the big picture and provide more general context to a particular matter (<em class="italic">our store doubled its sales in two years, but it is still the lowest-performing one in the region</em>).</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-140" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Distribution</h3>
			<p class="normal">This scene helps you highlight interesting patterns in the way data points are distributed. For instance, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>show how similar business entities can be grouped into homogeneous clusters (<em class="italic">our customer base can be split into four demographic groups: A, B, C, and D</em>) that can be described by their typical features (<em class="italic">customers in group A are predominantly single and earn between 50 and 75 thousand Swiss francs per year</em>). Alternatively, you can shed light on the relative position of an entity in the entire group (<em class="italic">our company financial results are in the top quartile of the industry</em>) or unveil anomalies (<em class="italic">store X is the outlier of the region as its shelf productivity is double that of the average of all others</em>).</p>
			<p class="normal">At the beginning of this section, we said a good data scene can always be summarized in a crisp, one-sentence statement: typically, this summary will leverage supporting data evidence. <em class="italic">Table 8.2</em> summarizes the five data scene types and the typical data facts you should use to make your point:</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Table 8.2: Data scene types with typical twists and supporting facts</p>
			<p class="normal">As you build your narrative, you can use this table as a reference and decide the specific twist you want to add to your data story and—importantly—which measure you will use to support it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Applying structure</h2>
			<p class="normal">Having selected your data scenes, it is time to pull them together in a coherent and engaging structure. Simplicity and directness always pay when communicating data insights, especially in a <a id="_idIndexMarker787"/>business environment. Hence, we are going to adopt a straightforward 3-act model for arranging our data story: it is based on the evergreen narrative structure of <strong class="keyword">Beginning</strong>, <strong class="keyword">Middle,</strong> and <strong class="keyword">End</strong>. This has been the backbone underlying the works of fiction from the Greek tragedy to the latest TV series on Netflix. Think about one of your favorite books or movies: it probably starts with an introduction to the main characters and a description of their normal life (the beginning), with maybe some hints of suspenseful anticipation of what is about to happen. </p>
			<p class="normal">Then (in the middle), a series of exciting events starts to occur: they take the characters through some significant changes with complications and obstacles on the way. These make the tension fluctuate and ultimately lead to a major crisis, or climax. Finally (in the end), tension falls, leaving the characters in a state of "new normality," which is usually different (and better, in the case of a happy ending) than the one depicted in the beginning.</p>
			<p class="normal">This structure works! In its simplicity, it can keep the tension moving in a way that makes the audience keep turning pages or staring at the screen. Let's go through each of the three acts and see how we can apply this structure (depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 8.2</em>) to build a compelling data story:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="image/B17125_08_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.2: The 3-act model of data stories. The ageless split of beginnings, middles, and ends still works</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-142" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Beginning</h3>
			<p class="normal">As you start your data story, you want to quickly grasp the attention of your audience by employing the so-called <strong class="keyword">Hook</strong>: this is a short statement (might not need any specific visual or supporting detail) that makes the audience eager to hear the rest of the story and willing to invest <a id="_idIndexMarker788"/>their mental energy in following you and your tale for a few minutes. Hooks that work well in a data story can be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">A partial preview of your key finding (<em class="italic">we are going to see what led to the 10% drop in customers satisfaction we experienced last month</em>).</li>
				<li class="bullet">A statement supporting the urgency of the topic you are going to talk about (<em class="italic">data suggests that we have only 20 days to reinforce our production line without impacting the fulfillment of open orders</em>).</li>
				<li class="bullet">The anticipation of the possible consequences if your recommendation gets acted upon (<em class="italic">we will learn how to increment sales in the coming summer by $2.1M versus last year</em>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">The other thing you need to do at the beginning of a data story is to provide some general <strong class="keyword">Context</strong> that puts everyone on the same page concerning the matter you are going to discuss. Think about the data scenes you want to stage later in the story: what background would the audience need to comprehend them fully? What is the current status of the business? Also, if some previous efforts have already been made on this subject (like earlier attempts to solve the same issue), it will be helpful to remind the audience right at the beginning what they were and why they were yet not entirely satisfying. </p>
			<p class="normal">Sometimes, data presentations start with a full description of the data sources, their scope and freshness, and detailed disclaimers related to its limitations. This is a double-edged sword, as it can stop the talk before it even starts: it can certainly lower the attention of the audience members who are less interested in those details. The advice is to keep this technical content to a minimum, mentioning only the highlights and keeping some backup material ready for you to go into more details only if it pops up as an issue.</p>
			<p class="normal">Another pitfall many presenters fall into is to share too much detail about their personal background relating to a project. This is another way to lose your audience's interest quickly. Only talk about yourself if it is useful to bolster your authority on the topic, and—even then—do that sparingly: talking too much about yourself will make your story go in the background. Being humble pays.</p>
			<p class="normal">By dropping an attractive hook and laying down the necessary context, you have completed the beginning of your story and are ready to move to its central part.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-143" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Middle</h3>
			<p class="normal">The middle of your story: this is where most of the action happens. In this part, you want to lay down the chain of scenes that gradually builds the logic supporting your case. As pointed <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>out by data storytelling expert Brent Dykes, the first thing you want to do is to identify the <strong class="keyword">Aha Moment</strong>: this is the climax of your data story—think of it as the play's focal scene. Once you are clear on the aha moment, you plan backward all previous scenes so that the audience is guided through a supporting flow of rising insights, which will ultimately lead them to the peak.</p>
			<p class="normal">Pixar's film director Andrew Stanton noticed that an audience always likes to <em class="italic">work for their meal</em>. Given our human tendency to deduce and deduct, he suggests that the build-up in the middle of a story should leave an opportunity for the audience to put things together by themselves, taking an active part in the process, without being handed every single step on a silver platter. <em class="italic">Don't give them four</em>, Stanton advises—<em class="italic">but give them two plus two</em>. When decision-makers feel they are part of the thinking process (instead of being spectators), they will be more likely to buy into your proposal. </p>
			<p class="normal">It's like a "connect the dots" puzzle game: the numbered dots tell you precisely what to do, but you still find some inner satisfaction in drawing the lines yourself and—maybe—unveiling something unexpected. One practical way to implement this trick of the trade is to present only part of the available data in a scene and ask the audience to think through what the rest would be. For example, you can leverage animations to visually enforce the gradual unveiling or stop and use a flipchart to gather ideas from the audience (and get them thinking) before resuming the flow and sharing your views. By asking them to participate in the thinking, you'll draw them into the process, which will connect them more closely to you. As they take a position on the matter, they will also directly confront their previous beliefs and maybe prove themselves wrong.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer347" class="packt_tip">
					<p class="Tip--PACKT-">Allowing audience participation can backfire: for example, some participants may intervene to distract attention to their specific objectives, jeopardizing your narrative. A trick to avoid this is to clearly state what you want your audience to do when requesting their participation: instead of just stopping and asking for general comments, pose a specific question and be clear on what particular action you expect in return.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="normal">When you are clear on how the rising insights lead to the aha moment scene, you can get to the next and final part of the story structure.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-144" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>End</h3>
			<p class="normal"><em class="italic">So what?</em> This is the most dreaded response an audience can have to a data story. You want to stay away from it at all costs. Remember: working on storytelling is not a way of <em class="italic">dressing up</em> data so it looks aesthetically pleasant or making its delivery more engaging just for the sake of it. A data story is instead a practical vehicle for facilitating a very practical goal: driving business action! The end of the story has the vital role of making the audience move forward from theory to practice, from a good idea to an actual change, from a <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>solid insight to an impactful decision. Many data stories—however logically sound and emotionally engaging—fail in the last leg of their journey and do not bring any significant consequence. To avoid this, you need to have two crucial elements in the concluding part of a story.</p>
			<p class="normal">The first one is a list of the key <strong class="keyword">Takeaways</strong>: these are the three to five messages that, no matter what, you want your audience to remember. Takeaways will undoubtedly include the summary of the aha moment scene and every recommendation you are leaving your audience with. Pick your takeaways carefully: they should be selected not depending on how proud you feel about having found them, but instead on how value-accretive for the business they would be for people to keep in mind (and act upon).</p>
			<p class="normal">The second element of a data story end is the list of proposed <strong class="keyword">Next Steps</strong>: this can be as simple as a bullet-point list or a table with the <em class="italic">What</em>, <em class="italic">Who,</em> and <em class="italic">By when</em> elements of every meaningful action you expect to happen after the session. It's essential not just to put the easy part (the description of what needs to happen) but also the name of the owner and the deadline for getting it completed to prevent your propositions from falling through the cracks of an ambiguous sense of accountability. Some of the next steps might be prepopulated in your delivery material as you anticipate them being needed, given what you plan to present. Some others might be decided on the spot when the audience finally gets a say on your story. In any case, you want to make sure you capture them in writing and validate the alignment of the various owners.</p>
			<p class="normal">Depending on the context in which your story is delivered (a short call with a few decision-makers, a large team meeting, or a townhall presentation, to name a few cases), you need to appropriately fine-tune the format of the end act of your story. You might need to add a short or long Q&amp;A and discussion part, so as to call the audience to actively participate and contribute to the decision or to define the required next steps.</p>
			<p class="normal">There is no one-size-fits-all format for it: just think through what your specific audience will likely prefer to do in the end part of your story and plan accordingly. Once you have prepared a sharp list of takeaways and some pragmatic next steps, you have all you need to end your story confidently, and you are ready to move to the next step of the data storytelling process: refining your scenes to make them great.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Polishing scenes</h2>
			<p class="normal">Sometimes, inexperienced <a id="_idIndexMarker791"/>data storytellers make the naïve assumption that it is enough to "let the data speak": their story ends up being an <strong class="keyword">Infodump</strong>, a conglomerate of charts copy-pasted in a long series of PowerPoint slides. The result? Making the audience confused, disengaged, and driving them further away from the original objective. By selecting the right (few) scenes and putting them in a solid 3-act structure, you have already taken some effective steps to avoid falling into the infodump trap. However, this is not sufficient, and before closing your story, you need to invest some time into polishing your scenes to make them <strong class="keyword">Focused</strong> and <strong class="keyword">Accessible</strong>.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-146" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Focusing attention</h3>
			<p class="normal">In data storytelling, as in many other things in life, <em class="italic">less is more</em>. Your audience's attention is a scarce and fragile resource, and you need to protect it at all costs. If you are telling your data story using only your voice, without any visual aids, then you want to keep your speech minimal: make your sentences short and crisp; refrain from adding unnecessary details unless your narrative requires them. If, as in most cases, you are putting together some supporting visual material (like slides with charts), you need to pass them through the <em class="italic">x-rays</em> of a rigorous necessity check. Every visual element in a slide will utilize part of the cognitive bandwidth of the viewer. You cannot afford to waste this resource—always in such a short supply—with embellishments, clutter, and nice-to-have additions.</p>
			<p class="normal">An effective way to <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>systematically preserve the focus in your data scenes is to follow this simple 2-step methodology:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbered" value="1">Recognize what needs to be in the <strong class="keyword">Foreground </strong>and what will remain in the <strong class="keyword">Background</strong>. Think about the key message you want to pass in the scene: all facts that directly support your point deserve to stay well lit in the foreground. On the other hand, all other data points providing contextual support to your message should be removed or visually muted. Differentiating between fore- and background elements is not hard work. If the message is <em class="italic">brand X is disproportionally growing versus the competition</em>, the line showing the growth of brand X is in the foreground, while competitors' brands are in the background. If, instead, you want to say <em class="italic">patients displaying these 2 symptoms (out of the 10 possible ones) are disproportionally more likely to be positive</em>, the 2 key symptoms should be in the front, leaving all others in the back to serve as context.<div id="_idContainer348" class="packt_tip"><p class="Tip--PACKT-">Non-data elements like graphical aids (gridlines, axes, and legends, to name a few), repeated text, and logos should always go in the background and should be visually muted (or, when not necessary, removed).</p></div></li>
				<li class="numbered">Once you are clear about what should be in the two layers of your scene, you need to leverage your graphical settings to "minimize" the prominence of the background elements in favor of those in the foreground. In many cases, data stories fail in differentiating these layers: all chart settings are just maintained in their "default" mode, forcing every graphical element (lines, bars, cells of tables) to be treated equally and none of them to stand out. You want exactly the opposite <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>to happen: the attention should naturally flow to a subset of the few items that should emerge from the mass. It's better to <strong class="keyword">Carve Out</strong> the nonessential instead of strengthening the crucial: by doing so, you avoid adding yet more visual elements, which might further distract your audience.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="normal">Here are the most frequently used ways you can direct the audience's attention to what matters the most:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Color</strong>: Give background elements a low-saturation color, preferably gray, and assign a high-saturation one to foreground elements. Most of the time, it will be enough for you to use a single, high-saturation color (like blue, orange, or even black) consistently in the foregrounds of all your scenes and just shades of gray for everything else. If only a specific part of a chart deserves to go in the foreground (like a portion of a line or a particular bar in a bar chart), apply your color to that part only: this will clearly highlight its unique role in the story.</li>
			
			</ul>
				<div id="_idContainer349" class="packt_tip">
					<p class="Tip--PACKT-">Careful with colors! Avoid the unconsidered use of many different colors in your story as they can seriously distract. The fewer colors appear in a data scene, the better: as a rule of thumb, never use more than five different colors in a single view.</p>
				</div>
			<ul>
			
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Size</strong>: Use thinner lines and smaller fonts for what should stay in the background. Thicker elements and bold typeface work very well to clearly distinguish what goes in front.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Grouping</strong>: An effective way to give focus to the foreground is to group together the background elements that do not need to stay separate. The typical cases are when you have many overlapping lines in the same chart (making them indistinguishable), or several (small) sub-bars stacked together that are hard to discern: you can fix them by aggregating the background smaller elements into a single item, which you may call <em class="italic">all others</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">The first part of your polishing is done: you have recognized what deserves to be in the foreground and have made it stick out from everything else.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-147" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Making scenes accessible</h3>
			<p class="normal">Clarity in data storytelling is a must, yet is quite tough to achieve. Your audience might be very diverse in terms of background, seniority, prior knowledge on the matter, and attention span. Because of this diversity, presenting clearly to every single member of the audience requires some extra effort. If you want to be inclusive, your data scenes should be easily <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>accessible by everyone and, as much as possible, self-explanatory. You might be an expert on what you are presenting: yet—remember—it shouldn't take your expertise to follow your story in full.</p>
			<p class="normal">As you build the visual support of your data story, you can make use of some proven methods to make your slides straightforward and accessible to everyone:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Action titles</strong>: Make sure that the title of every slide directly conveys the point you want to make with it. A bad title is <em class="italic">Sales evolution forecast (in US$), next three years</em>, while a good title is <em class="italic">We expect sales to grow by 50% in 2.5 years from now</em>. Use the title to tell your audience what you want them to know rather than just providing contextual information on what they are seeing. You can use other features (like axis titles) to explain the metrics you display. Do you remember when we said that scenes could be summarized by using a succinct and crisp sentence? Make that sentence the title of your slide.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Guiding labels</strong>: Add textboxes that signal and explain the interesting part of the data you are showing. The typical case is when you circle some data points or a portion of a line and add some text nearby to explain <em class="italic">what's going on</em> there. If needs be, feel free to use lines or arrows to connect the data you want to specify with the text annotation it refers to. By just looking at the guiding labels, the audience should automatically understand most of the action in your scene, without any need to explain.</li>
			
			</ul>
				<div id="_idContainer350" class="packt_tip">
					<p class="Tip--PACKT-">Use colors to link text and visual elements referring to the same entity. For example, if a blue line refers to a specific brand, use precisely the same blue when mentioning that brand in the title or a label. This is a very effective way to make your material self-explanatory and unambiguously guide your audience through it. Remember to stay consistent in color choices across the whole story.</p>
				</div>
			<ul>
			
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Build-up animations</strong>: Consider structuring your visual material in a way that builds up progressively in a few steps. This is a powerful way to convey more complex thinking, which lets you guide your audience progressively, showing more and more labels and chunks of the data as they enter one scene after another. Animations are also suitable for reinforcing the emotional load of some scene types like evolution (<em class="italic">this is the profit we made in the last year, and...</em> (animation proceeds adding forecasted development)... <em class="italic">this is where it can go next year if the product launch is successful</em>) and breakdown (<em class="italic">out of all the new users who subscribed in Spain</em>... (animation proceeds showing a drilldown)... <em class="italic">more than 80% were solely due to the acquisition</em>). Moreover, animations prevent the audience from reading ahead on your material: their curiosity can distract them from the points you want to make and derail their attention away from the flow you prepared so carefully for them.</li>
				<li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Readability</strong>: A too-busy slide is likely to cause your audience to stop focusing on your narrative while trying to decode what they see. Avoid the visual infodump: if it's too much content, you should ask yourself what can be removed or kept as a backup material. If it is all needed, you can use multiple charts for it. Be miserly in the <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>number of words you write: the fewer, the better. By keeping the word count at a minimum, you also protect yourself from the unfortunate choice of "reading your slides" instead of making their content shine through your delivery. You should also check the readability of the fonts you use: take two steps back from your computer screen and check if you can read with ease all the numbers and text in there.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">Using titles, labels, and animations wisely, you can make the visual material supporting your data scenes self-explanatory and easily understandable by everyone in your audience. Once you have polished all the parts of your story, you are finally able to move further.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148" class="title" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Finalizing your story</h2>
			<p class="normal">The data storytelling process is iterative. Now that you have the full picture of what your data story looks like as a <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>whole, you can go through it and critically assess whether you have opportunities to improve it further. The following <strong class="keyword">Checklist</strong> includes a set of valid (and sometimes harsh) questions you should ask yourself at this stage:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">Does the story meet its original objective? Picture in your mind the desired outcome (a decision, a change, an approval): how likely is it to become reality thanks to this story's delivery?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Is the current script in line with the logistic constraints you have? Is it reasonable to think that you will have enough time to deliver it fully? Are you giving enough time for Q&amp;A and discussions?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Is this going to be compelling for the audience and, in particular, for the key decision-makers? Put yourself in their shoes, one by one: how will they react? Is this resonating with what's hot in their mind now? Is this what you want them to be thinking? Is this really what they care about? What questions will they ask?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Do you have a <a id="_idIndexMarker797"/>strong and clear initial hook? Is it compelling for the key decision-makers?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Are you providing enough initial context? Are you making the objective clear for the audience at the beginning?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Have you got a clear list of data scenes you will stage? Out of these scenes, is there one prominent versus the other? Is this one really going to drive an "Aha!" reaction?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Are the rising insights building up in a way that the audience can easily follow? Are you clear on the one single message you want to leave in each scene?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Are you using the right supporting facts for each scene, according to type (see <em class="italic">Table 8.2</em>)?</li>
				<li class="bullet">In the visual materials you use to support the data scenes, are there clear action titles? Is the data in the foreground standing out from everything else? Are you highlighting the crucial elements with crisp guiding labels? Are colors used consistently? Are the fonts too small?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Are you wrapping up your key takeaways in the end? Are the takeaways no more than 5?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Do you have a list of proposed next steps with a clear owner, a description, and a deadline for each?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Are you leveraging rhetorical modes to be persuasive (see <em class="italic">Table 8.1</em>)? Are you and your story looking credible? Is there anything you can add, like sources, a bio, and testimonials to enhance credibility?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Rethink carefully the logical thinking you are offering and ask someone to be critical and play the role of the devil's advocate. Is it sound? Will it be understood and followed by all of your audience? Is there a weak link in the logical chain?</li>
				<li class="bullet">Are you creating <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>an emotional connection with the audience by using imagery, metaphors, and personal experiences? Will your result be agreeable and humble or unpleasant and arrogant?</li>

			<p class="normal">As you get ready for your story delivery, make sure you allow for some quality time for some good rounds of <strong class="keyword">Rehearsals</strong>. Some of the weaknesses of your story will only become apparent when you are actually going through it. There is no better way to refine your story and acquire self-assurance for the delivery than rehearsing a couple of times. I strongly recommend preparing a <strong class="keyword">Script</strong> of what you want to say. Depending on your confidence level in speaking, you can jot down just a summary or a bullet-point list of the key messages to give or write a full word-by-word script. Even if you don't have the opportunity to read through the script when delivering the story live, you will highly benefit from having prepared the script: trust me, it works!</p>

					<p class="Tip--PACKT-">If you decide to put together a full script of your story, make sure your delivery does not come across as robotic or mechanical. Rehearse the script a few times so you don't have to read it through. </p>

			<p class="normal">The many concepts, models, and tips we encountered in this chapter's content-rich pages will certainly<a id="_idIndexMarker799"/> need some practice to become habits. To keep them all at hand, you can use the <strong class="keyword">Data Storytelling Canvas</strong>, which you find in <em class="italic">Figure 8.3</em> (you can also download a printable version from the book site if you wish):</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.3: The data storytelling canvas. Follow the structure to build your next story</p>
			<p class="normal">The structure <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>of the canvas serves as the scaffolding to build a data story effectively. The boxes of the canvas will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">Force you to think through some preliminary aspects such as the objectives and the audience (first things first!).</li>
				<li class="bullet">Guide you through the unmissable parts of a data story (beginning, middle, and end), giving you space to add placeholders for your scenes as you build the narrative.</li>
				<li class="bullet">Provide a quick reference (like the list of data types and a short version of the checklist) that is useful to keep handy during the preparation process.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">You can use the canvas in solo mode to guide your individual thinking. If you have the opportunity to build a story as a team effort, you can reuse the structure of the canvas to support a cooperative design session. In this case, all inputs and ideas can be added as post-it notes in the various boxes or as text annotations on a virtual whiteboard when meeting virtually. Give it a try next time: it is an efficient way to brainstorm and gather collective ideas, ultimately leading to great stories.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-150" class="title"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="normal">I hope you enjoyed as much as I did the intense journey in the vast and fascinating world of data storytelling that this chapter took us through. We can be great data analysts or respected business domain experts. However, in a business organization, we will often lack the full authority required to make decisions freely and make things happen, even if data certifies the validity of our points. Storytelling extends the potential of data analytics as it lets us transform data into value-creating actions.</p>
			<p class="normal">We started by applying the ageless enablers of persuasion (being credible, offering logical reasoning, and driving emotional engagement) to business data, and we explored the many reasons stories can make a difference in advocating our data-based recommendations. Then, we went through a systematic process for building data stories that stick, leveraging the (simple but effective) 3-act story structure and the five archetypal data scene types. Afterward, we acquired a set of practical tips for polishing our story and finetuning it to make its delivery most likely to secure our desired outcome. We concluded by exploring a practical tool (the data storytelling canvas) that we can leverage at the time of need.</p>
			<p class="normal">One last consideration before closing and moving on: strangely enough, in this data storytelling chapter, you didn't find any data charts. You should now be clear on the difference between storytelling and data visualization, which are sometimes mixed together confusingly. Charts do not "convince" anyone by themselves, while stories do. It's much easier to craft a nice-looking visual than to actually build an engaging story based on a solid narrative. I hope you are convinced about the need to be good at both, and that you now see the utmost centrality that storytelling has in data analytics.</p>
			<p class="normal">I told you so: this was the chapter you didn't expect!</p>
