    faced by many data practitioners who cannot have their points—however truthful

    there are multiple routes for leveraging data analytics to create economic value,

    to influence others to make the right decisions or take the appropriate actions.
    Think about this now: all you have seen so far in the book—all the efforts to
    transform your data, find insights, and build robust models—will sadly remain
    useless if we miss the last bit of the chain, which is impacting the actions of

    7 times better if they are memorized by creating a fictional story that includes
    them. Other studies demonstrated that narrative texts could be read twice as fast

    well that it is only a work of fiction and none of it is real. Yet we might be
    captivated by it and we keep watching it, moving greedily to the next episode.
    How is that possible? This happens because when we are in front of a story, we
    tacitly sign an agreement called the **Narrative Pact**. It reads something along
    the lines of: "I agree to momentarily suspend my disbelief as I know that something
    good will come out from this story, either in terms of new knowledge or experience"
    (such as entertainment or a momentary disconnection from reality). When somebody
    is telling us a story, we agree to concede the benefit of the doubt as we accept
    the prospect of being surprised (and even change our mind). Many business situations
    will require you to move your audience out of their current beliefs, so the narrative
    pact is exactly what you need! A large majority of decision-making is driven by
    gut feel and earlier personal experiences. When you begin telling a story, you
    get your audience to implicitly sign a narrative pact, and this is an excellent
    way to get open-minded listening from them.'

    rehearsing a couple of times. I strongly recommend preparing a **Script** of what
    you want to say. Depending on your confidence level in speaking, you can jot down
    just a summary or a bullet-point list of the key messages to give or write a full
    word-by-word script. Even if you don''t have the opportunity to read through the
    script when delivering the story live, you will highly benefit from having prepared
    the script: trust me, it works!'

    does not come across as robotic or mechanical. Rehearse the script a few times
    so you don't have to read it through.

- en: I hope you enjoyed as much as I did the intense journey in the vast and fascinating
    world of data storytelling that this chapter took us through. We can be great
    data analysts or respected business domain experts. However, in a business organization,
    we will often lack the full authority required to make decisions freely and make
    things happen, even if data certifies the validity of our points. Storytelling
    extends the potential of data analytics as it lets us transform data into value-creating
    actions.

    logical reasoning, and driving emotional engagement) to business data, and we
    explored the many reasons stories can make a difference in advocating our data-based
    recommendations. Then, we went through a systematic process for building data
    stories that stick, leveraging the (simple but effective) 3-act story structure
    and the five archetypal data scene types. Afterward, we acquired a set of practical
    tips for polishing our story and finetuning it to make its delivery most likely
    to secure our desired outcome. We concluded by exploring a practical tool (the
    data storytelling canvas) that we can leverage at the time of need.

    data storytelling chapter, you didn''t find any data charts. You should now be
    clear on the difference between storytelling and data visualization, which are
    sometimes mixed together confusingly. Charts do not "convince" anyone by themselves,
    while stories do. It''s much easier to craft a nice-looking visual than to actually
    build an engaging story based on a solid narrative. I hope you are convinced about
    the need to be good at both, and that you now see the utmost centrality that storytelling
    has in data analytics.'
