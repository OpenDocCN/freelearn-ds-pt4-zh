    faced by many data practitioners who cannot have their points—however truthful

    there are multiple routes for leveraging data analytics to create economic value,
    which we called data-to-value paths. In most cases, to create value, we need data
    to influence others to make the right decisions or take the appropriate actions.
    Think about this now: all you have seen so far in the book—all the efforts to
    transform your data, find insights, and build robust models—will sadly remain
    useless if we miss the last bit of the chain, which is impacting the actions of

- en: '**Stories stick more than statistics**. Multiple cognitive psychology studies
    confirm that facts will stick in our brain much better when connected in a narrative
    than when they are separate. As a famous experiment by Stanford professors Gordon
    Bower and Michal Clark proved, people can remember a list of random words 6 to
    7 times better if they are memorized by creating a fictional story that includes
    them. Other studies demonstrated that narrative texts could be read twice as fast
    and recalled twice as well compared to expository texts. By just adding a plot

- en: '**Stories encourage acceptance**. When we watch a sci-fi series, we know perfectly
    well that it is only a work of fiction and none of it is real. Yet we might be
    captivated by it and we keep watching it, moving greedily to the next episode.
    How is that possible? This happens because when we are in front of a story, we
    tacitly sign an agreement called the **Narrative Pact**. It reads something along
    the lines of: "I agree to momentarily suspend my disbelief as I know that something
    good will come out from this story, either in terms of new knowledge or experience"
    (such as entertainment or a momentary disconnection from reality). When somebody
    is telling us a story, we agree to concede the benefit of the doubt as we accept
    the prospect of being surprised (and even change our mind). Many business situations
    will require you to move your audience out of their current beliefs, so the narrative
    pact is exactly what you need! A large majority of decision-making is driven by
    gut feel and earlier personal experiences. When you begin telling a story, you
    get your audience to implicitly sign a narrative pact, and this is an excellent
    way to get open-minded listening from them.'

    have the power to create a state of emotional connection, or empathy, between

    from the original objective. By selecting the right (few) scenes and putting them
    in a solid 3-act structure, you have already taken some effective steps to avoid
    falling into the infodump trap. However, this is not sufficient, and before closing

    short and crisp; refrain from adding unnecessary details unless your narrative
    requires them. If, as in most cases, you are putting together some supporting
    visual material (like slides with charts), you need to pass them through the *x-rays*
