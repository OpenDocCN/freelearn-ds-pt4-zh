			<p class="normal">It was a long ride, but you made it: what a terrific journey you have just completed! </p>
			<p class="normal">In the nine chapters, we have harnessed, with our own hands, the potential value of data analytics, recognizing several practical ways to unlock it. We have built a toolbox of ready-to-use data applications (with KNIME and Power BI at the core), which you can now utilize when needed. Most importantly, you have acquired a broad set of tool-agnostic data competencies that you can leverage with <em class="italic">any</em> application. Organizing, cleaning, and transforming any data; building, validating, and interpreting models based on machine learning algorithms; designing, preparing, and delivering data stories based on effective visualizations...this wide spectrum of fundamental knowledge and data abilities will empower you, no matter the specific software you happen to use today or will use tomorrow. The tutorials you completed gave you some real-world experience on relevant business needs, such as automating data pipelines, predicting consumer behavior, anticipating prices, creating meaningful customer segments, and building interactive dashboards. Congratulations on getting all of this done—you have a lot to be proud of!</p>
			<p class="normal">If you enjoyed this journey, you might be asking "...and what now"? As we conclude the ride, let me share two pieces of advice I received earlier in my journey, which I have found tremendously helpful in my personal and professional life.</p>
			<p class="normal">The first one is to <strong class="keyword">stay curious</strong> and never stop learning. That is easier said than done. Personal development will not happen by itself and needs proper planning. Book some time in your weekly schedule (why not a couple of hours every Friday?) to read more books on the aspects of data analytics that intrigue you the most. Follow blog posts (<em class="italic">Towards Data Science</em>, <em class="italic">Data Science Central</em>, <em class="italic">Low Code for Advanced Data Science</em>, and <em class="italic">Storytelling with Data</em> are some of my favorites), and take online or traditional courses (<em class="italic">Coursera</em> and <em class="italic">edX</em> platforms are packed with free, high-quality university courses—a "classic" one that meant a lot to me was <em class="italic">Machine Learning</em> by Andrew Ng). You want to stay constantly aware of what's being done and what's coming. Data analytics is a multidisciplinary, fluid field, and you need to embrace a true growth mindset to navigate it fully. Transform every situation in which you don't know how to do something into an opportunity to learn. Stay curious!</p>
			<p class="normal">The second one is to intentionally scout for opportunities to <strong class="keyword">apply what you learned to your daily work</strong>. I suggest you plan what to do with your new skills down the line. Since you have everything fresh in your mind, do it now: take a blank piece of paper and draft the two or three experiments you can put into practice right away. How about putting together a simple dashboard with the data your team uses the most? Or, creating a compelling story with the hottest business challenge? Try automating a tedious data cleaning process, or use one of the machine learning algorithms you have learned to improve the way decisions are made today. You don't need to aim for anything sophisticated and glamorous. I have seen many great data analytics initiatives start with only two basic ingredients: the excitement of a small group of people who enthusiastically believe they have a great idea and a quick and dirty prototype that proves the value of the idea and gets more people on board. My advice is to do this systematically: force yourself to select a few ideas to test. Start now.</p>
			<p class="normal">If you are out of ideas or you don't have enough data, consider joining <a href="http://kaggle.com"><span class="url">kaggle.com</span></a> and participating in some of its analytics contests: you will receive juicy datasets, some real briefs, and the opportunity to compete with other professional or amateur data practitioners. Alternatively, ask a local charity whether they need any help tidying their data or creating value for their cause. There are plenty of opportunities around you to leverage data analytics today: go find them.</p>
			<p class="normal">I wrote this book to empower you and to get you excited about data analytics. I hope it did the trick. In any case, I would be delighted to connect with you: do get in touch with me (you will find my contact details below; the easiest way is to add me on LinkedIn and send me a message). Every bit of feedback, every opinion, or—even better—the story of a data analytics success you drove will be highly appreciated, and I promise to respond in any way I can.</p>
			<p class="normal">I wish you all the best in your continuous development, and I hope that data analytics will benefit you on your path!</p>
