- en: In the nine chapters, we have harnessed, with our own hands, the potential value
    of data analytics, recognizing several practical ways to unlock it. We have built
    a toolbox of ready-to-use data applications (with KNIME and Power BI at the core),
    which you can now utilize when needed. Most importantly, you have acquired a broad
    set of tool-agnostic data competencies that you can leverage with *any* application.
    Organizing, cleaning, and transforming any data; building, validating, and interpreting
    models based on machine learning algorithms; designing, preparing, and delivering
    data stories based on effective visualizations...this wide spectrum of fundamental
    knowledge and data abilities will empower you, no matter the specific software
    you happen to use today or will use tomorrow. The tutorials you completed gave
    you some real-world experience on relevant business needs, such as automating
    data pipelines, predicting consumer behavior, anticipating prices, creating meaningful
    customer segments, and building interactive dashboards. Congratulations on getting
    all of this done—you have a lot to be proud of!

    the ride, let me share two pieces of advice I received earlier in my journey,
    which I have found tremendously helpful in my personal and professional life.

    said than done. Personal development will not happen by itself and needs proper
    planning. Book some time in your weekly schedule (why not a couple of hours every
    Friday?) to read more books on the aspects of data analytics that intrigue you
    the most. Follow blog posts (*Towards Data Science*, *Data Science Central*, *Low
    Code for Advanced Data Science*, and *Storytelling with Data* are some of my favorites),
    and take online or traditional courses (*Coursera* and *edX* platforms are packed
    with free, high-quality university courses—a "classic" one that meant a lot to
    me was *Machine Learning* by Andrew Ng). You want to stay constantly aware of
    what's being done and what's coming. Data analytics is a multidisciplinary, fluid
    field, and you need to embrace a true growth mindset to navigate it fully. Transform
    every situation in which you don't know how to do something into an opportunity
    to learn. Stay curious!

- en: 'The second one is to intentionally scout for opportunities to **apply what
    you learned to your daily work**. I suggest you plan what to do with your new
    skills down the line. Since you have everything fresh in your mind, do it now:
    take a blank piece of paper and draft the two or three experiments you can put
    into practice right away. How about putting together a simple dashboard with the
    data your team uses the most? Or, creating a compelling story with the hottest
    business challenge? Try automating a tedious data cleaning process, or use one
    of the machine learning algorithms you have learned to improve the way decisions
    are made today. You don''t need to aim for anything sophisticated and glamorous.
    I have seen many great data analytics initiatives start with only two basic ingredients:
    the excitement of a small group of people who enthusiastically believe they have
    a great idea and a quick and dirty prototype that proves the value of the idea
    and gets more people on board. My advice is to do this systematically: force yourself
    to select a few ideas to test. Start now.'

    and participating in some of its analytics contests: you will receive juicy datasets,
    some real briefs, and the opportunity to compete with other professional or amateur
    data practitioners. Alternatively, ask a local charity whether they need any help
    tidying their data or creating value for their cause. There are plenty of opportunities
    around you to leverage data analytics today: go find them.'

    I hope it did the trick. In any case, I would be delighted to connect with you:
    do get in touch with me (you will find my contact details below; the easiest way
    is to add me on LinkedIn and send me a message). Every bit of feedback, every
    opinion, or—even better—the story of a data analytics success you drove will be
    highly appreciated, and I promise to respond in any way I can.'
