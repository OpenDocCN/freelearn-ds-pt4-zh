    up from being a data scientist to leading data teams, there are a myriad of challenges.
    It can be challenging to understand underlying concepts of statistics, machine
    learning, and AI; manage data teams effectively; and, most importantly, translate
    complex models into tangible business outcomes – business outcomes that deliver
    real, bottom-line value to an organization, not just vanity metrics and shiny
    demos.
