<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Data science </span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">is not a new </span><a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">term; in fact, it was coined in the 1960s by Peter Naur, a Danish computer science pioneer who used the term data science to describe the process of working with data in various fields, including mathematics, statistics, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">computer science.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Later, the modern use of data science began to take shape in the 1990s and early 2000s, and data scientist, as a profession, became more and more common across </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">different industries.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">With the exponential rise in artificial intelligence, one may think that data science is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">less relevant.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">However, the scientific approach to understanding data, which defines data science, is the bedrock upon which successful machine learning and artificial intelligence-based solutions can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">be built.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Within this book, we will explore these different terms, provide a solid foundation in core statistical and machine learning theory, and concepts that can be applied to statistical, machine learning and artificial intelligence-based models alike, and walk through how to lead data science teams and projects to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">successful outcomes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">This first chapter introduces the reader to how statistics and data science are intertwined, and some fundamental concepts in statistics which can help you in working with data. </span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">We will explore the differences between data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, explain the relationship between statistics and data science, explain the concepts of descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as probability, and basic methods to understand the shape (distribution) </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">of data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">While some readers may find this chapter covering basic, foundational knowledge, the aim is to provide all readers, especially those from less technical backgrounds, with a solid understanding of these concepts before diving deeper into the world of data science. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">For more experienced readers, this chapter serves as a quick refresher and helps establish a common language that will be used throughout </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">the book.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">In this next section, let's look at these terms of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, how they are related, and how </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">they differ.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">You may have heard the terms data science, AI, and ML used interchangeably, but they are distinct concepts with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">unique characteristics.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">AI is a broad field that focuses on developing computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual </span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">ML is a subset of AI that involves training computer systems to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task without being </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">explicitly programmed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">ML algorithms enable computer</span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1"> systems to learn from data and identify patterns, which can then be used to make predictions or decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">While all ML falls under the umbrella of AI, not all AI encompasses ML, as some AI systems may rely on rule-based or symbolic </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">reasoning approaches.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Deep learning is a specific type of ML that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to extract higher-level features from raw data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">This technique is highly effective for tasks such as image and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">speech recognition.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Data science is a multidisciplinary field that involves extracting and analyzing relevant insights from data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">It focuses on discovering hidden patterns and relationships in data to derive meaningful conclusions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">A data scientist leverages ML algorithms to make predictions and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">inform decision-making.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">All these fields are grounded in the foundations of mathematics, probability theory, and statistics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Understanding these core concepts is essential for anyone interested in pursuing a career or leading initiatives in data science, AI, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">or ML.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">The following is an attempt to visualize the relationship between </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">these fields:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Here, deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and artificial intelligence is a broader field which includes machine learning and other</span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> methods to perform </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">intelligent tasks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Data science, as a practice, overlaps with all these fields, as it can make use of whichever methods are most appropriate to extract insight, predictions, and recommendations from data. </span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">All these fields are built upon the foundation of mathematics, probability, and statistics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">For this reason, in the next section, we will investigate these mathematical and statistical underpinnings of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">data science.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">This book is aimed at the business-focused </span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">decision maker, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">not</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1"> the technical expert, so you might be wondering why are we starting by talking </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">about mathematics.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Well, at its core, data science is based on mathematical and statistical foundations, so even if you aren’t working as a data scientist or ML/AI engineer, having a basic understanding of the important mathematical and statistical concepts that are used within data science is one of the most important tools you can have at your disposal when working with data scientists or leading data science, ML, or AI initiatives, whether that’s interpreting the models and results that data scientists and ML engineers bring your way, better understanding the limitations of certain data and models, and being able to evaluate which business use cases may or may not be appropriate for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">data science.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Research has found that 87% of data science projects never make it into production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">In other words, only around one in ten projects get to the stage where they can provide bottom-line value for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">a company.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">These results seem poor at first glance, but there is a silver lining. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">In many cases, the missing piece of the puzzle is strong executive leadership, knowing which use cases are appropriate for data science, providing the data science teams with good-quality, relevant data, and framing the use cases in a way where data science can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">applied successfully.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Knowing some of the core concepts around mathematics and statistics for data science will not only give you a better appreciation of data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">science but also the compass to plan and navigate data science projects from the outset to reach more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">successful results.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Within this book, we won’t be attempting to provide anything like a comprehensive foundation into mathematics required for AI and ML as this would require an entire degree to achieve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">However, within this chapter, we will provide you with an understanding of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">the fundamentals.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Having a foundation in statistical knowledge is crucial for individuals embarking on a journey into leading projects or teams within the field of data science. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">It enables them to gain a competitive advantage in extracting valuable insights from data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Statistics plays a vital role as it offers various tools and techniques to identify patterns and uncover deeper insights from the available data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">A good grasp of statistics allows individuals to think critically, approach problem-solving creatively, and make data-driven decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.5">In this section, we aim to cover essential statistical topics that are relevant to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">data science.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">What is statistics?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Before going further, it will be helpful to define what we mean by </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">statistics</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1"> as the term can be used in several different ways. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">It can be used to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1"> do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Indicate the whole discipline </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">of statistics</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Refer to the methods that are used to collect, process, and interpret </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">quantitative data</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Refer to collections of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">gathered data</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Refer to calculated figures (such as the mean) that are used to interpret the data that’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">been gathered</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">In this case, we define statistics using the second definition – the methods that are used to collect, process, and interpret </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">quantitative data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Today, few industries are untouched by statistical thinking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">For example, within market research, statistics is used when sampling surveys and comparing results between groups to understand which insights are statistically significant; within life sciences, statistics is used to measure and evaluate the efficacy of pharmaceuticals; and within financial services, statistics is used to model and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">understand risk.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">I’m sure you’re familiar with many of these and other applications of statistics, and you may have studied statistics before at school, college, or in your professional career, and much of what follows in this chapter may not be brand </span><a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">new information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Even if this is the case, it can be useful to have a refresher as unfortunately, it’s not possible to pause a career to complete a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">statistics course.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">When you’re leading data science, ML, or AI initiatives, understanding statistics is an essential skill, whether you’re working with simple statistical models or understanding the data being used or a model’s performance when you’re training and evaluating deep learning </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">AI models.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">With this in mind, let’s dive into some of the core concepts within probability </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">and statistics.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Descriptive and inferential statistics</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">It’s important to understand that there are two different types of statistics: descriptive statistics (methods used to summarize or describe observations) and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1"> inferential statistics (using those observations as a basis for making estimates or predictions) – that is, inferences </span><a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">about a situation that has not been </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">investigated yet.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Look at the following two example statements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Which of them is a “descriptive” statistic and which </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">is “inferential?”</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Based on our forecasting, we expect sales revenue next year to increase </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">by 35%.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">Our average rating within our customer base was 8 out </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">of 10.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">The first statement is inferential as it goes beyond what has been observed in the past to make inferences about the future, while the second statement is descriptive as it summarizes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">historical observations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">Within data science, often, data is first explored with descriptive statistics as part of what is known as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">exploratory data analysis</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">EDA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">), attempting to profile </span><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><a id="_idIndexMarker027"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">and understand the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">Following this, statistical or ML models trained on a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker028"/><a id="_idIndexMarker029"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">set of data (known as model training) can be used to make inferences on unseen data (known as model inference or execution). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">We will revisit this</span><a id="_idIndexMarker030"/><a id="_idIndexMarker031"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1"> topic later in this book when we cover the basics </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">of ML.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">The distinction between descriptive and inferential statistics depends on the differences between </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">samples</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1"> and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">populations</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">, two more important terms </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">within statistics.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">In statistical terminology, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">population</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1"> not only refers to populations of people, but it may also equally refer to populations of transactions, products, or retail stores. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">The main point is that “population” refers to every example within a studied group. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">It may not be the case that a data scientist is interested in every attribute of a population – it may be that they are only interested in the sales revenues of retail stores or the price </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">of products.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">However, even if a data scientist is interested in one characteristic of a population, they will likely not have the luxury to study all members of it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">Usually, they will have to study a sample – a relatively small selection – from within a population. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">This is often due to the limitations of time and expense, or the availability of data, where only a sample of the data </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">is available.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">In this case, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sampled data, and it is with inference that a data scientist can attempt to go beyond the available data to generalize information to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">entire population.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">So, to summarize, descriptive statistics involves</span><a id="_idIndexMarker032"/><a id="_idIndexMarker033"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1"> summarizing a sample, whereas inferential statistics is concerned with generalizing a sample to make inferences about the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">entire population.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">How accurate are these generalizations from the sample to the population? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">This is a large part of what statistics are about: measuring uncertainty</span><a id="_idIndexMarker034"/><a id="_idIndexMarker035"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1"> and errors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">It is useful, when working with the results from statistical models or even ML models, to be comfortable with the idea of uncertainty and how to measure it, not to shy away from it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.3">Sometimes, business stakeholders may not want to see the margins of error, along with the outputs of simple statistical techniques, as they want to know things with complete certainty. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.4">Otherwise, any degree of uncertainty shown alongside results might be blown out </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">of proportion.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">However, we can rarely observe an entire population when making inferences, or have a model generalize to every possible edge case, to have absolute certainty in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">any result.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">However, we can do a lot better than human intuition, and it is better to take a more scientific stance to understand and measure the margin of error and uncertainty with our inferences and predictions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">Unconsciously, we make decisions every day with partial information and some uncertainty. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.3">For example, if you’ve ever booked a hotel, you may have looked at a sample of hotels and read a sample of customer reviews but had to decide on which hotel to book based on this sample. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.4">You may have seen a hotel with one five-star review and another with 1,000 reviews averaging 4.8 stars. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.5">Although the first hotel had a higher average rating, which hotel would you book? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.6">Probably the latter, because you could infer that the margin of error in the rating was less, but importantly there is still some margin of error as not every customer may have given </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">a review.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">In the data science, ML, and AI worlds, this ability to investigate and understand uncertainty when working with data science and have criteria around what margin of error would be acceptable for your business use case is critical to knowing when to proceed with deploying a model </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">to production.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">In data science, sampling is the process of selecting a subset of data from a larger population. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">Sampling can be a powerful tool for decision-makers to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker036"/><a id="_idIndexMarker037"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">draw inferences and make predictions about the population, but it is important to choose the right sampling strategy to ensure the validity and reliability of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">the results.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">Random sampling</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">Random sampling is the most common and straightforward </span><a id="_idIndexMarker038"/><a id="_idIndexMarker039"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">sampling strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">In this method, each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">This can be done through a variety of techniques, such as</span><a id="_idIndexMarker040"/><a id="_idIndexMarker041"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1"> simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">cluster sampling.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">Simple random sampling involves randomly selecting individuals from the population without any restrictions or stratification. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">Stratified random sampling involves dividing the population into strata or subgroups based on certain characteristics and then randomly selecting individuals from each stratum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.3">Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and randomly selecting entire clusters to be included in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">the sample.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">Random sampling can be useful when the population is large and homogenous, meaning that all members have similar characteristics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">However, it may not be the best strategy when the population is diverse and there are significant differences </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">between subgroups.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">Convenience sampling</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">Convenience sampling involves selecting individuals</span><a id="_idIndexMarker042"/><a id="_idIndexMarker043"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1"> from the population who are easily accessible or available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">This can include individuals who </span><a id="_idIndexMarker044"/><a id="_idIndexMarker045"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">are in a convenient location, such as in the same office or building, or individuals who are readily available to participate in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">the study.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">While convenience sampling can be a quick and easy way to gather data, it is not the most reliable strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">The sample may not be representative of the population as it may exclude certain subgroups or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">over-represent others.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">Stratified sampling</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into </span><a id="_idIndexMarker046"/><a id="_idIndexMarker047"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">subgroups based on certain characteristics and then selecting individuals from each subgroup to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker048"/><a id="_idIndexMarker049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1"> be included in the sample. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">This strategy can be useful when the population is diverse and there are significant differences </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">between subgroups.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">In stratified sampling, the size of the sample is proportional to the size of each subgroup in the population. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">This ensures that each subgroup is adequately represented in the sample, and the results can be extrapolated to the population with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">greater accuracy.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">Cluster sampling</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">Cluster sampling involves dividing the population</span><a id="_idIndexMarker050"/><a id="_idIndexMarker051"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1"> into clusters and randomly selecting entire clusters to be included in the sample. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">This strategy can be useful when the population is geographically dispersed or when it is easier to access clusters </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">than individuals.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">Cluster sampling involves dividing the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker052"/><a id="_idIndexMarker053"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1"> population into clusters, which are typically based on geographic proximity or other shared characteristics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">From these clusters, a random sample of clusters is selected, and all members within the selected clusters are included in the sample. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">This strategy can be useful when the population is geographically dispersed or when it is more feasible to access and survey entire clusters rather than </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">individual participants.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">Cluster sampling is often more cost-effective and efficient than other sampling methods, especially when dealing with large, spread-out populations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">However, it may lead to higher sampling error compared to simple random sampling if the clusters are not representative of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">entire population:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">Random variables are mathematical functions </span><a id="_idIndexMarker056"/><a id="_idIndexMarker057"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">that are utilized to assign a numerical value to each potential outcome of a random process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">For example, when flipping a coin, the value of 0 can be assigned to tails and 1 to heads, effectively causing the random variable, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">X</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">, to adopt the values of 0 </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">or 1:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">For example, the outcome of rolling a six-sided die is a discrete random variable as it can only take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.2">On the other hand, the height of a person is a continuous random variable as it can take on any value within a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">certain range.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">Random variables are often used in the context of sampling strategies as they provide a way to model and analyze uncertain outcomes in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">a sample.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">For example, suppose a decision maker wants to estimate the average height of students at a university. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">One possible sampling strategy would be simple random sampling, in which a random sample of students is selected from the population of all students at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">the university.</span></span></p>

<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">Degrees of freedom</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1"> is a fundamental concept in statistics</span><a id="_idIndexMarker085"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1"> that refers to the number of independent values or quantities that can vary in an analysis without breaking any constraints. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">It is essential to understand degrees of freedom when working with various statistical tests and models, such as t-tests, ANOVA, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">regression analysis.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">In simpler terms, degrees of freedom represents the amount of information in your data that is free to vary when estimating statistical parameters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.2">The concept is used in hypothesis testing to determine the probability of obtaining your observed results if the null hypothesis </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">is true.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">For example, let’s say you have a sample of ten observations and you want to calculate the sample mean. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">Once you have calculated the mean, you have nine degrees of freedom remaining (10 - 1 = 9). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.3">This is because if you know the values of nine observations and the sample mean, you can always calculate the value of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">10th observation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">The general formula for calculating degrees of freedom is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">as follows:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">Understanding degrees of freedom is crucial for data science leaders as it helps them interpret the results of statistical tests and make informed decisions based on the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.2">It also plays a role in determining the complexity of models and avoiding overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex</span><a id="_idIndexMarker086"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1"> and starts to fit the noise in the data rather than the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">underlying patterns.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">Correlation, causation, and covariance</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">Correlation, causation, and covariance are important concepts in data science, ML, and decision-making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">They are all related to the relationship between two or more variables and can be used to make predictions and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">inform decision-making.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">Correlation</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">Correlation is a measure of the strength</span><a id="_idIndexMarker087"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1"> and direction of the relationship between two variables. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.2">It is a statistical measure that ranges from -1 to 1. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.3">A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, a correlation of 0 indicates no correlation, and a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">negative correlation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">For example, suppose we want to understand the relationship between a person’s age and their income. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.2">If we observe that as a person’s age increases, their income also tends to increase, this will indicate a positive correlation between age </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">and income.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">Causation</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">Causation refers to the relationship</span><a id="_idIndexMarker088"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1"> between two variables in which one variable causes a change in the other variable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.2">Causation is often inferred from correlation, but it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">imply causation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">For example, suppose we observe a correlation between the number of ice cream cones sold and the number of drownings in a city. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.2">While these two variables are correlated, it would be incorrect to assume that one causes the other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.3">Rather, there may be a third variable, such as temperature, that causes both the increase in ice cream sales and the increase </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">in drownings.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">Covariance</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">Covariance is a measure of the joint variability</span><a id="_idIndexMarker089"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1"> of two variables. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.2">It measures how much two variables change together. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.3">A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that the two variables tend to change in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">opposite directions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">For example, suppose we want to understand the relationship between a person’s height and their weight. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.2">If we observe that as a person’s height increases, their weight also tends to increase, this will indicate a positive covariance between height </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">and weight.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">Correlation, causation, and covariance are important concepts in data science. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">By understanding these concepts, decision-makers can better understand the relationships between variables and make better-informed decisions based on the analysis of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">the data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">Covariance measures how two variables change together, indicating the direction of the linear relationship between them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.2">However, covariance values are difficult to interpret because they are affected by the scale of the variables. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.3">Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure that ranges from -1 to +1, making it easier to understand and compare the strength and direction of linear relationships </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">between variables.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">It is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation and that other factors may be responsible for observed relationships between variables. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">A strong correlation between two variables does not automatically mean that one variable causes the other as there may be hidden confounding</span><a id="_idIndexMarker090"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1"> factors influencing both </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">variables simultaneously.</span></span></p>
