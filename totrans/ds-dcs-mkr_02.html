<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Characterizing and Collecting Data</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">In the previous chapter, we focused on general concepts and ideas around probability and statistics, but how does this translate to the data within your organization or for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">your project?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">In this chapter, we will cover different types of data you might find within your organization, methods for collecting and processing that data to apply the statistical techniques covered in the previous chapter, and more advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques we will cover in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">later chapters.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Before we dive into topics such as the different categories of data and methods for collecting, storing, and processing data, we need to ask a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">fundamental question:</span></span></p>
<p class="author-quote"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">“What data in my organization is valuable and useful?”</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Initially, this might seem like a trivial and obvious question, but many data science projects start on the wrong foot by not properly evaluating the feasibility of achieving business results with the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">data available.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Often, decision-makers incorrectly assume that the data can be used for the identified business </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">use case.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">There is a lot of data out there and not all data is created equally, so it is worth understanding whether it fits the criteria for your business </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">use cases.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">In this chapter, you will learn about different types of data, as well as methods for collecting and processing data so that it can be prepared for data science </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">use cases.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">To give you a clearer idea of how to unlock the valuable data within, or external to, your organization, we will cover the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">following topics:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">The key criteria to consider when </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">evaluating data</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">The difference between first-, second-, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">third-party data</span></span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">To better understand how to unlock the valuable data within, or external to, your organization, let’s explore the key criteria to consider when </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">evaluating datasets.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">What are the key criteria to consider when evaluating datasets?</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">In this </span><a id="_idIndexMarker121"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">section, we will understand what the key criteria are when it comes to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">evaluating datasets.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Data quantity</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Is there sufficient data to train an accurate model or to make inferences about a wider population if </span><a id="_idIndexMarker122"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">you’re working with a data sample? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">As mentioned in the previous chapter, in statistics, you must often work with a limited sample of data, and the ability of that sample to represent the wider population often depends </span><a id="_idIndexMarker123"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">on the size of the sample. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Within machine learning, models trained on larger datasets perform much better than those trained on a small sample. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">There are more advanced techniques, such as data augmentation and transfer learning, that can help in this situation and will be covered later, but an initial consideration is whether there is enough data available to meet business requirements </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">around accuracy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Consider, for instance, a customer churn model designed to predict which customers are at risk of leaving. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">To effectively generalize to current and future customers, it’s important to assess whether there is sufficient historical data and an adequate number of examples of customers closing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">their accounts.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Data velocity</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Another </span><a id="_idIndexMarker124"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">consideration is data velocity, which is how frequently </span><a id="_idIndexMarker125"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">data is generated or travels. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Some data may not update very frequently, such as a company’s quarterly profit and loss, whereas other data may be very frequent, or even real time, such as stock prices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">The solutions that data teams build need to be able to handle the frequency of the incoming data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">For example, batch systems might need to process data daily or streaming systems (such as Kafka) might be required for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">real-time data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">The velocity or frequency of the data required also depends on the business use case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">For example, a public relations issue tracker that monitors news and social media sentiment </span><a id="_idIndexMarker126"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">may require data every minute to detect </span><a id="_idIndexMarker127"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">emerging issues quickly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Another example would be predictive maintenance, where data outputs from IoT sensors within manufacturing equipment would benefit from being streamed in real time to detect issues and defects so that they can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">resolved quickly.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Data variety</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">For some use cases, a single source of data will not be sufficient to make accurate inferences </span><a id="_idIndexMarker128"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">about a population or provide compelling insights to the end users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">One </span><a id="_idIndexMarker129"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">industry where this is often the case is market research, where the data from a single survey may not provide the in-depth insights around consumer behavior the brand or company is looking for, and combining this data with additional data sources, such as product reviews, consumer social media data, or sales data, will provide the context to understand </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">consumer behavior.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Data quality</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Finally, one of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker130"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">the key criteria to evaluate is the quality </span><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">of the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Data quality and governance is a whole domain within itself, but some of the things you must consider are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">as follows:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Accuracy</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">: Data is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker132"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">accurate when it reflects reality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">This could refer to the value of financial transactions accurately reflecting the exact amount spent, consumer survey responses reflecting the respondents’ true opinions, or customer details within a CRM being accurately filled for a given customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">Data should not always be assumed to be accurate, and high data accuracy can allow models to be trained and inferences to be made that can also be trusted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.4">The expression “garbage in, garbage out” is often used to describe </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">this fact.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Completeness</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">: Data is “complete” when all fields required for a particular use case are </span><a id="_idIndexMarker133"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">present. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">It doesn’t necessarily mean that all fields need to be complete. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">For example, if a company is looking to understand the average price of products from different vendors, then fields such as price, quantity, and pack size are important to complete, but other fields, such as ingredients, product descriptions, or product image URLs, are not as important for this </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">use case.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Uniqueness</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">: Data is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker134"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">unique if it appears only once within a given dataset. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">Sometimes, duplicates are expected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">For example, in a set of financial transactions, the same customer can appear many times across transactions, and this is nothing to worry about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">However, in other situations, such as within a master list of customers within a CRM, each customer should be unique, and having duplicates can lead to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">inaccurate reporting.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Consistency</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">: Consistency is an important factor when it comes to data as it ensures that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker135"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">the values within a single record and across multiple datasets do not conflict with each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">For example, a postcode should always begin with the same characters that represent the locality of the address, and the date of birth for any given individual should be the same across different datasets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">By ensuring consistent data, it is possible to link information from multiple sources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">This can add to your dataset and increase its value by providing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">additional insight.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Timeliness</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">: Relevant to the data velocity criteria, the timeliness of data is also a consideration </span><a id="_idIndexMarker136"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">for data quality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">More recent data may be required to accurately represent the current-day situation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">Take, for example, a loan default model a bank may have to predict the probability of customers defaulting on loans. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.4">If this model was trained on old historical data where the macroeconomic environment was different, and interest rates were lower, then the data that’s used for training may not be timely enough to make accurate inferences about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">current customers.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Validity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">: Validity is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker137"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">a measure of how well data conforms to the expected format, type, and range. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">For example, a valid US postcode must be within the range of 00001 to 99950, and a valid email address must consist of an email prefix and an email domain separated by an “@” symbol. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Often, tools such as regular expressions (a way of checking that data matches a certain pattern) or cross-referencing against standard datasets (such as ISO standards) can be used to ensure data is valid. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">Having valid data means that it can be used in harmony with other sources, and it helps to ensure that automated data processes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">run efficiently.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">Now that we’ve discussed the key criteria for evaluating datasets, it’s important to understand that data can come from various sources, such as first parties, second parties, and third parties. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">Let’s look into these different types </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">of data.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">First-, second-, and third-party data</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Within any mid to large-sized organization, you can find a vast swathe of different types of data that serve unique purposes and can provide valuable insights when harnessed effectively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">Even if your organization does not have easily accessible or useful internal data to suit the business use cases you have identified, it is possible to look outside your organization toward external data sources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">This is where the concepts of first-, second-, and third-party data are useful </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">to understand.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">The following diagram represents how your data (darker) interacts with data from external organizations (lighter) for the definitions of first-, second-, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">third-party data:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">First-party data</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1"> is data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker138"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">that’s internal to your organization, such as customer data or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">employee data.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Second-party data</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1"> is data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker139"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">that’s shared as part of a data-sharing partnership or agreement with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">another organization.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">Third-party data</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1"> is data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker140"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">that’s collected from external sources, such as proprietary or open </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">source APIs:</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Let’s take a closer look </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">at each.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">First-party data – the treasure trove within</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">First, we will begin with first-party data – the data that your organization collects directly from its customers, users, or other sources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">Have you ever considered the wealth of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker141"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">information that lies within your systems? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">Customer interactions, sales transactions, website analytics, and even employee records are all examples of first-party data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.3">This data is invaluable as it provides organizations with a unique perspective on their customers, products, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">and services.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">But why is first-party data so important? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">The answer lies in its accuracy, relevance, and control. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.3">Since it is collected directly from the source, it is often considered the most reliable and accurate type of data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.4">Furthermore, this data is inherently relevant to your organization’s specific needs and goals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.5">Lastly, your organization maintains full control over its first-party data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and minimizing potential </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">data breaches.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Consider, for example, the insights gained from analyzing customer purchase history or website behavior. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.2">How can these insights inform marketing strategies, product development, or even customer support? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.3">By effectively harnessing first-party data, organizations can unlock a treasure trove of insights </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">and opportunities.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">Second-party data – building bridges through collaboration</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Next, we will cover second-party data, which is essentially another organization’s first-party data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker142"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">that is shared or purchased for mutual benefit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">While this may initially seem counterintuitive, sharing data can lead to fruitful collaborations and partnerships, expanding your organization’s reach and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">knowledge base.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">What makes second-party data valuable? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">The answer lies in its exclusivity and potential for collaboration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.3">Second-party data can provide unique insights that are not readily available in the public domain, giving your organization a competitive edge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.4">Furthermore, the process of sharing data can lead to collaborative opportunities and foster </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">strategic partnerships.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Imagine, for example, a retail company collaborating with a payment processing platform to better understand customer spending habits and preferences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">By sharing data, both organizations stand to benefit from enhanced insights and informed decision-making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.3">However, it is crucial to ensure that all parties involved adhere to strict data privacy and security standards when sharing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">second-party data.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">Third-party data – broadening horizons with external expertise</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">Finally, let’s consider third-party data, which is collected by organizations that specialize in aggregating </span><a id="_idIndexMarker143"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">and selling data to other businesses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">This data can offer insights into market trends, demographics, and other valuable information that may be difficult or time-consuming to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">collect internally.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">Why should organizations consider third-party data? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">The answer lies in its breadth, specialization, and potential for uncovering new opportunities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">Third-party data can provide access to a wide range of datasets, including industry-specific information, demographic data, and location data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.4">These providers often possess specialized expertise in collecting and analyzing data, ensuring </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">high-quality insights.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Picture, for example, a company in the fast-moving consumer goods industry looking to expand its product offerings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">By acquiring third-party data on consumer preferences and market trends, the company can make informed decisions regarding product development and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">marketing strategies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">Another example might be a company looking to understand how companies are talking about their brand online, through social listening. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">This would involve collecting and analyzing third-party social media data from sources such as X (formerly Twitter) </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">and Reddit.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">It is important </span><a id="_idIndexMarker144"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">to note, however, that the quality of third-party data can vary, and organizations must carefully evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the data </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">they purchase.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">While categorizing data based on its source is essential, it’s also important to understand how data can be structured differently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">In the next section, we’ll explore the differences between structured, unstructured, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">semi-structured data.</span></span></p>
