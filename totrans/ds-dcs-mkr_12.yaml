    decision-making, or both? Your first hires will be the most important, and having
    an excellent, committed technical lead will help steer your future hiring.

    to find talent than ever, but the competition for top talent is high. Teams that
    work well generally have a strong core of full-time hires and leverage part-time
    or contract workers and external consultants as appropriate. Each of these talent
    pools has its own advantages and trade-offs.

- en: With the complexity of modern ML/AI systems, having the right tools for data
    management, experiment tracking, model versioning, and so on makes a huge difference
    to productivity. Standardizing the workflow helps teams scale. Often, the additional
    cost of improved tooling and infrastructure can outweigh the cost of the additional
    time the team spends on optimizing inadequate tooling to “make it work.” Remember,
    every hour the data science/machine learning team spends on dealing with poorly
    performing tools and infrastructure has its own cost, and may likely outweigh
    the cost of better tooling.

    of a “strategic focus on results, not just research” in building Google’s AI capabilities.

    activity, when in reality, the most transformative breakthroughs come from close
    collaboration between research and product teams focused on real-world impact.

    a high-performing data science team, emphasizing that data science is a team sport
    requiring diverse skills and expertise. We discussed the different roles that
    make up a data science team, including data scientists, machine learning engineers,
    data engineers, and others, as well as different models for structuring the team,
    such as embedded, integrated, and hub and spoke. Building a successful data science
    team requires careful consideration of the specific needs of your organization,
    the skills and expertise needed, and the structure that will work best for your
    projects.
