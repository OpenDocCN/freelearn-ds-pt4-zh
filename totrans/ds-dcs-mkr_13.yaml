    Almost every customer touchpoint within Uber’s rider app incorporates some aspect
    of machine learning. As a technology-first company, Uber has the advantage of
    a strong engineering team, but the most successful companies of the future, whether
    a bank, a retailer, or an insurance company, will also be deploying machine learning
    and artificial intelligence features into their core offerings.

- en: In this chapter, we explored the unique challenges and opportunities in managing
    a data science team, including fostering a culture of rapid experimentation, managing
    inherent uncertainty, balancing research and production work, communicating effectively,
    cultivating curiosity and continuous learning, implementing peer review and collaboration,
    empowering the team, aligning projects with business goals, scaling and operationalizing
    models, deploying robust, reliable, fair, and ethical artificial intelligence,
    driving adoption of data science work, and empowering other teams to leverage
    data. While tactical excellence in managing data science teams is crucial, realizing
    the full potential of data science requires leaders who can navigate the strategic
    challenges involved in driving data-driven transformation.
