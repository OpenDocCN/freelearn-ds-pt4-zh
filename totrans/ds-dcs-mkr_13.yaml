    from traditional leadership contexts. The volatile nature of data science – with
    its reliance on machine learning and artificial intelligence – demands not just
    technical acumen but a nuanced approach to leadership. This chapter provides a
    concise exploration of effective management strategies tailored specifically to
    the high-stakes and high-innovation environment of data science.
