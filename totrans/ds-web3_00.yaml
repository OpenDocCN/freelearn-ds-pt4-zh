- en: The advent of Web3 has ushered in a trove of data, characterized by its distinctive
    properties, giving rise to novel concepts and breathing new life into established
    ones. Within the expansive Web3 ecosystem, data assumes diverse forms, stored
    across multiple platforms and formats, ranging from on-chain transactional data
    to independent news aggregators, oracles, and social networks. In essence, Web3
    is a continuous generator of data directly or indirectly related to its ecosystem.

- en: Web3, with its inherent characteristics, has unlocked value on various fronts.
    **Decentralization** has demonstrated that businesses without central authorities
    are possible. **Trustless** interactions have driven coordination between entities,
    facilitating smooth exchanges of goods and services over the blockchain, even
    among strangers and without intermediaries. This has resulted in value transfers
    reaching remote corners of the world at minimal costs, fostering direct connections
    between artists and collectors and facilitating crowdfunding by directly supporting
    product developers, among a myriad of other applications.

- en: However, one aspect of Web3 that remains relatively unexplored, yet holds immense
    value to unlock, is **transparency**. Transparency fosters reliance, a cornerstone
    for mass adoption. A significant milestone for the industry will be achieved when
    ordinary individuals seamlessly engage with it, grounded in trust due to accessible
    and verifiable information. To fully realize the potential of transparency, many
    Web3 data scientists and analysts, equipped with the requisite skills, conceptual
    knowledge, tools, and a profound understanding of the data and business landscape,
    are needed. This is what this book aims to do – empower you to evolve into Web3
    data specialists capable of understanding and extracting value from data.

- en: The book is structured into three parts. The first section covers foundational
    concepts necessary to execute data analysis tasks. You will gain insights into
    on-chain data, learn to access and extract insights, explore sources of relevant
    off-chain data, and navigate potential obstacles. Additionally, two domains that
    generate vast amounts of data, namely NFTs and DeFi, are examined in depth, each
    presenting its own set of business rules and technical concepts.

    Web3 data. We have curated practical cases that data scientists, whether freelancers
    or employed professionals, may encounter in their work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *Appendix* addresses the question, what should we do with the knowledge
    acquired? It provides guidance on navigating the decentralized work landscape,
    understanding industry expectations for prospective data employees, and identifying
    the soft and hard skills necessary for success. In order to offer a glimpse into
    the future of the industry, we have engaged with Web3 data leaders who share their
    experiences, perspectives, and visions. The intent of this part is to shorten
    the time required to find jobs or other ways to contribute in the industry.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The benefits of decentralization, trustless interactions, and transparency in
    trade cannot be ignored, and that is why the industry continues to grow year by
    year, unlocking new use cases and creating new jobs. The purpose of this book
    is to contribute to the understanding of the data that Web3 generates so that
    you can be prepared to shape *the next era of* *the internet*.

- en: The format of the book and the list of topics covered make it suitable for data
    professionals interested in the Web3 ecosystem. The explanations have been simplified,
    catering to professionals with no data science background but eager to leverage
    data tools for in-depth analysis of blockchain data. You are encouraged to engage
    with the shared repository and experiment with the provided solutions, fostering
    a hands-on learning experience. Although not mandatory, a basic understanding
    of statistics, machine learning, SQL, and Python would be advantageous.
