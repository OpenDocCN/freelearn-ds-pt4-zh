    to invest in based on relevant metrics. You may have some ideas about what metrics
    to consider, but how do you know which metric and value is the most relevant to

    data) and data that is not on-chain (off-chain data), we can identify patterns
    and insights that will help us make informed decisions. For example, we might
    find that certain protocols are more active during business hours in a time zone
    different from where the bank is located. In this case, the bank can decide whether
    they are ready to make an investment in a product serving clients in a different
    time zone. We may also check the value locked in the protocol to assess the general
    investors’ trust in that smart contract, among many other metrics.

    data visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib, are useful in meetings

    need to build an ingestion pipeline for consumption by the data scientist. This

    include manual entry, web scraping, live streaming from devices, or a connection
    to an API. Data can be presented in a structured format, meaning that it is stored
    in a predefined way, or an unstructured format, meaning that it has no predefined
    storage format and is simply stored in its native way. **Transformation** consists
    of modifying the raw data to be stored or analyzed. Some of the activities that
    data transformation can involve include data normalization, data deduplication,
    and data cleaning. Finally, **loading** is the act of moving the transformed data
    into data storage and making it available. There are a few additional aspects
    to consider when referring to data availability, such as storing data in the correct
    format, including all related metadata, providing the correct access privileges
    to the right team members, and ensuring the data is up to date, accurate, or enough
    to fulfill the data scientist’s needs. The ETL process is generally led by the
    data engineer, but the business owner and the data scientist will have a say when
    identifying the data source.

    reach our desired destination, but it comes at a cost. The price of gas fluctuates
    based on various factors, such as oil prices and transportation costs. The same
    concept applies to the blockchain technology. To save a transaction on a chain,
    it is necessary to pay for gas. In short, gas is the instruction cost paid to
    the network to carry out our transactions. The purpose of establishing a cost
    is twofold: the proceedings of the gas payment go to the miners/validators as
    a payment for their services and as an incentive to continue being integrated
    into the blockchain; it also sets a price for users to be mindful of when using
    resources, encouraging the use of the blockchain to record only what is worth
    more than the gas value paid. This concept is universal to all networks we will
    study in this book.'

    characters is essential for identifying the country, bank, and account of the
    recipient, for the entity that holds our funds. Similarly, an address performs
    a comparable function and serves as an identification number on the blockchain.
    It is a string of letters and numbers that can *send or receive* cryptocurrency.
    For example, Ethereum addresses consist of 42 hexadecimal characters. An address
    is the public key hash of an asymmetric key pair, which is all the information
    required by a third party to transfer cryptocurrency. This public key is derived
    from a private key, but the reverse process (deriving the private key from a public
    key) cannot be performed. The private key is required to authorize/sign transactions
    or access the funds stored in the account.

    smart contracts are deployed and are controlled by their contract code. Another

    because the rules include potential penalizations or “slashing” of the deposited
    cryptocurrency if the validator (node that processes transactions and adds new

    slots. Each validator is given a slot to propose a block during that time, and
    if all validators are online, there will be no empty slots, resulting in a new
    block being added every 12 seconds. The second concept is the timestamp for when
    a block was added to the blockchain, which is typically stored in Unix timestamp

    and sustainability of DeFi platforms. One of the industries most impacted by this
    technology is the financial industry, which has given birth to a new concept known
    as **Decentralized Finance**, or **DeFi**. DeFi consists of peer-to-peer financial
    solutions built on public blockchains. These initiatives offer services that are
    similar to those offered by banks and other financial institutions, such as earning
    interest on deposits, lending, and trading assets, without the intervention of
    banks or other centralized financial institutions. This is achieved through a
    set of smart contracts (or protocols) that are open to anyone with an address
    to participate.

    allows users to lend and borrow various cryptocurrencies without intermediaries
    such as banks. For instance, if Jane wants to borrow 10 ETH, she can go to Aave,
    create a borrowing request, and wait for the smart contract to match her request
    with available lenders who are willing to lend ETH. The borrowed ETH is lent with
    an interest rate percentage that reflects supply and demand levels. The money
    lent comes from a liquidity pool where lenders deposit their cryptocurrencies
    to earn interest on them. With Aave’s decentralized platform, borrowers and lenders
    can transact directly with each other without needing to go through a traditional
    financial institution.

    users secure in it. The TVL will increase when users deposit more assets in the

    by the current price.

    multiplying the number of coins or tokens issued by their current market price.
    The **circulating supply** is the sum of tokens currently held by public holders.
    To get this number, we calculate the tokens in all addresses that are not the

    prices is connecting to an online marketplace for cryptocurrencies, commonly known
    as exchanges, such as **Binance** or **Kraken**, to extract their market prices.
    However, commercialization in these markets can be halted for various reasons.
    For example, during the well-known **Terra USD** (**TUSD**) de-peg incident, when
    the stablecoin lost its 1:1 peg to the US dollar, many exchanges ceased commercialization,
    citing consumer protection concerns. If our workflow relies on such data, it can
    be disrupted or show inaccurate old prices. To solve this issue, it is advisable
    to source prices from sources that average the prices from multiple exchanges,

    once received, it is confirmed and can be considered complete. In the blockchain

    transactions of different amounts to be considered valid.

    mined simultaneously in different parts of the world. The protocol waits for the
    next block to be mined and, depending on where it attaches, determines which chain
    is the longest (the longest chain is deemed the valid one). A block in Bitcoin
    that doesn’t become part of the longest chain is referred to as a **stale block**,
    while in Ethereum (prior to the merge), they were known as **uncle blocks**. Once
    a transaction is incorporated into a block, it is assigned one confirmation. If
    our transaction finds its way into a stale block, it will be reversed and return
    to the mempool in Bitcoin or be added to another block in Ethereum, resuming the
    count of confirmations.

    transaction counterparties to request a certain number of confirmations before
    accepting that their transactions are irreversible. The longer the chain grows
    after the block that included our transaction, the less likely it is to be reversed.
    Following the merge in Ethereum (which took place at block `15537394`), uncle
    blocks ceased to be generated, but some of these practices persist among market
    participants.

    can vary, with some suggesting six confirmations for Bitcoin and only two for

    two confirmations for Bitcoin and 35 for Ethereum.

    those assets have to be counted as lost. With this information in mind, it is
    safe to assume that some of the Bitcoin supplied as of today is already lost or
    will be. When reading the blockchain, we can see those funds in possession of
    a certain address, but it is entirely possible that such an address is unable
    to dispose of them. Since this is a pseudo-anonymous system, we cannot contact
    the Bitcoin holders and ask them to verify whether they have access to their funds;
