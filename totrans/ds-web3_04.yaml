    various economic use cases. We will begin by understanding what an NFT is, how
    the relevant information is logged in transaction data, and the alternatives to
    obtaining it. Additionally, we will analyze how this technology is being leveraged

    refer to as “protocols.” We will delve into the fundamental protocol metrics,
    offering quick insights into each protocol’s structure and user composition. To
    do that, we can choose to use a data framework, which is a highly valuable tool
    for business analysts as it helps organize our analyses and craft a compelling
    narrative when presenting our findings. An example of such a structure is the
    *Reach, Retention, and* *Revenue* framework.

    into the profitability of a product. It’s worth noting that the Covalent team
    has designed a data analyst training program, which we will cover in more detail

    remarkably successful in driving the adoption of this technology while reshaping
    the landscape of rewards and ownership.

- en: The gaming industry has undergone a significant transformation, shifting from
    a “pay-to-play” model where players were required to purchase physical cartridges,
    CDs, or subscriptions to access game content, to a “free-to-play” online format.
    The advent of blockchain technology has further pushed the boundaries by introducing
    the **Play-to-Earn** (**P2E**) model. P2E grants property rights to gamers, allowing
    them to truly own in-game assets. In the past, players might have acquired in-game
    perks or items, but they had no real ownership, making it impossible to sell or
    exchange such assets. The integration of NFTs into the gaming ecosystem has brought
    about real change, providing players with a genuine sense of ownership and paving
    the way for the convergence of gaming and finance through blockchain technology.
    This transformation has extended beyond the realm of the games themselves, impacting
    players’ lives outside of the virtual world. Consequently, a new business structure
    has emerged, known as **gaming guilds**, which are designed to lease relevant
    in-game assets to players while also offering training and community support to
    their members.

    which onboarded a massive number of non-crypto users into the ecosystem, achieving
    unprecedented numbers in the industry. Axie Infinity brought mainstream adoption
    to blockchain gaming. At the time of writing this book, numerous games are being

    and finance in a market segment is known as GameFi and is made possible by blockchain

    protocol names of **ENS** for **Ethereum Name Service** and **RNS** for **RIF
    Name Service**. These projects follow the concept of the traditional **Domain
    Name Service** (**DNS**), which replaced IP addresses with human-readable names
    for accessing websites. In the same fashion, these protocols lease or sell human-readable
    names on the blockchain, which help replace the long hex strings that identify
    an address, making it easier to interact with brands and individuals on the blockchain.
    An added advantage is that these name services are decentralized and thus impervious
    to censorship by central authorities.

    tracking authenticity, which is something that investors and galleries invest

- en: Pieces of art have been used as a venue for money laundering in the past. In
    the traditional art market, various entities such as galleries, auction houses,
    dealers, and more interact and have knowledge that supports pricing in a relatively
    controlled environment. However, the Web3 market is intentionally more open, with
    anyone able to create and sell a collection without intermediaries. The price
    is determined by the interaction of supply and demand, and value can fluctuate
    subjectively. AML practitioners see a risk of money laundering occurring in this
    environment.

    include constant outliers in the floor price of some NFTs or instances of wash
    trading. A recent paper issued by the US Government named *Study of the Facilitation
    of Money Laundering and Terror Finance through the Trade in Works of Art* mentioned
    wash trading as a way to self-launder flows of money in the following terms: “*Furthermore,
    NFTs can be used to conduct self-laundering, where criminals may purchase an NFT
    with illicit funds and proceed to transact with themselves to create records of
    sales on the blockchain. The NFT could then be sold to an unwitting individual
    who would compensate the criminal with clean funds not tied to a* *prior crime.*”'

- en: In this chapter, we delved into the world of NFTs, exploring their structure
    and gaining insights into acquiring data for three crucial use cases. We took
    a deep dive into the game use case, with the analysis of the Wolf Game. Additionally,
    we examined ENS, shedding light on its role in online identity. Finally, we ventured
    into the expansive and ever-evolving art ecosystem, where we covered the activities
    of artists and marketplaces and generated metrics related to floor price and wash
    trading. In all these cases, we combined metrics derived from transactional data
    duly showcased on a Dune dashboard (https://dune.com/gabriela/chapter-4-nft) and
    state data in this book’s Jupyter notebooks.

    tip of the iceberg. The NFT landscape is incredibly diverse, and we might encounter
    requests to analyze NFTs in various other domains, such as fashion, proof-of-attendance
    protocols (POAPs) for specific events, government registries undergoing migration,
    or even non-nominative airplane tickets, as exemplified by TravelX.

    questions that open new avenues for exploration. If we join on-chain data with
    Web2 data like some initiatives are doing (for example, [https://www.spindl.xyz/](https://www.spindl.xyz/)),
    we can enhance the user base profiling of the participants of a certain NFT collection
    and improve the community’s engagement, develop more targeted features, and improve
    our product based on data-driven decisions.
