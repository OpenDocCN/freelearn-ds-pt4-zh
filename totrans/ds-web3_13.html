<h1 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor347"/>Building Experience with Crypto Data – BUIDL</h1>
<p class="author-quote">If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. – Benjamin Franklin, 1790</p>
<p>Education empowers us to create value, whether by contributing to a company or establishing our ventures. If you’ve acquired this book, it is because you recognize the potential to unlock value from blockchain data—value that the market would pay for. In the Web3 landscape, there are a lot of <strong class="old">BUIDLing</strong> opportunities to create solutions that contribute to the adoption of a more transparent system. According to Binance’s website (<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/buidl">https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/buidl</a>): “<em class="italic">BUIDL is a warping of the word “build” in the same fashion as “HODL.” BUIDL is a call to arms for building and contributing to the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem (…) The BUIDL movement believes that (…), people should start contributing proactively in order to help adoption and improve the ecosystem </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">people invested.</em></span><span class="No-Break">”</span></p>
<p>We have learned how to extract value; now, let’s see what the market is willing to offer for that knowledge. Global brands such as Adidas and Nike and fashion icons such as Hermès have acknowledged this opportunity and established departments focused on Web3 analysis. Similarly, we can observe an ever-growing list of data-related roles on job search engines and company career websites, indicating the abundance of opportunities in this field. To grab those opportunities, we need to <span class="No-Break">start </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">BUIDLing</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of building a portfolio and where to <span class="No-Break">showcase it</span></li>
<li>Where to search for jobs on <span class="No-Break">dedicated websites</span></li>
<li>Where to study Web3 <span class="No-Break">data skills</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor348"/>Showcasing your work – portfolio</h1>
<p>Building a<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> portfolio serves two primary purposes. Not only does it cater to potential job seekers but also to contractors, consultants, and business owners in search of prospective clients, and it also showcases our <span class="No-Break">soft skills.</span></p>
<p>Firstly, a portfolio <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>demonstrates what we have accomplished and the depth of our knowledge. It leaves a lasting impact on interviewers when we can show our work rather than merely describing it. For instance, if we have built a dashboard on Ethereum, it indicates our ability to replicate the process on other chains. Secondly, through the portfolio-building process, we gain valuable insights into the language, technical jargon, and current trends in <span class="No-Break">the industry.</span></p>
<p>A portfolio also highlights soft skills that are highly valued by the market. We will delve into these soft skills later in this chapter, such as curiosity, passion, learning agility, <span class="No-Break">and initiative.</span></p>
<p>There are many guides on how to build a portfolio for coding in general and data science in particular. Let’s now explore where we can build our data analytics portfolio and where we can showcase <span class="No-Break">our work.</span></p>
<p>Some of the following suggestions rely on collaborative building as analysts do not need to start from scratch when crafting a piece of analysis. They can use other analysts’ work to fork their query, learn from it, modify it, and, in sum, build on top <span class="No-Break">of it:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="old">Create a Dune Analytics dashboard</strong>: Dune Analytics is an excellent tool that grants <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>open access to data for anyone to query. Building dashboards on Dune is open and free, and each public query can be read and reproduced. Noteworthy dashboards recognized by the community receive a “star,” and featured analysts are designated as “wizards.” These dashboards can be embedded into websites, and data generated by queries can be downloaded as <strong class="source-inline">.csv</strong> files. For assistance, Dune Analytics provides a series of informative videos on its Web3 data <span class="No-Break">system: </span><a href="mailto:https://www.youtube.com/@dunecom"><span class="No-Break">https://www.youtube.com/@dunecom</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li><strong class="old">Create an Increment dashboard</strong>: Covalent, introduced in <a href="B19446_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, offers the<a id="_idIndexMarker718"/> Increment tool, a set of no-code models that simplify analysis for those unfamiliar with SQL. These models combine dimensions and measures, tailored to cover <strong class="old">reach, retention, and revenue</strong> analyses. For example, the retention area includes all necessary elements for building cohort analyses or analyzing multichain user bases, among<a id="_idIndexMarker719"/> other dimensions. All queries can be integrated into a dashboard and publicly embedded, such as <span class="No-Break">on Notion.</span></li>
<li><strong class="old">Create a Flipside dashboard</strong>: Flipside, also introduced in <a href="B19446_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, allows analysts to<a id="_idIndexMarker720"/> build publicly available dashboards. With over 20 indexed blockchains and all log events adequately translated, analysts can query data with ease. Flipside also incentivizes analysts through a rewards system, where the creators of useful dashboards trending in the community and on social media are compensated. Further information can be found <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://docs.flipsidecrypto.com/our-app/analyst-rewards/top-8-dashboard-rewards"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.flipsidecrypto.com/our-app/analyst-rewards/top-8-dashboard-rewards</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li><strong class="old">Create X (formerly Twitter) threads with Web3 data analytics</strong>: As previously described, open<a id="_idIndexMarker721"/> blockchain data serves as the backend for many dApps open for monitoring. Traditionally, getting our hands on financial data was expensive and difficult, and access was limited to analysts at banks, hedge funds, and law firms that could turn it into analysis sold to clients for a lot of money. Now, it is possible to see first-class Web3 analysis backed up by real-time data where analysts can decipher trends, uncover root causes, and provide valuable insights based on concrete data, rather than mere speculation. Data is key, but if no data analyst can extract insights from it to convert it to information and knowledge, it loses a lot of <span class="No-Break">its value.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there are corporate initiatives funded by private companies that enable analysts to showcase their work. Companies occasionally run projects open to the community, which can serve as a <span class="No-Break">recruitment process.</span></p>
<p>A recent example is Nansen, an analytics company that conducted a scout program, encouraging participants to complete a set of requests, particularly helping their attribution team to tag addresses. More information can be found <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://www.nansen.ai/post/introducing-the-nansen-scouts-program"><span class="No-Break">https://www.nansen.ai/post/introducing-the-nansen-scouts-program</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor349"/>Looking for a job</h1>
<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker722"/> primary platform to find jobs directly focused on Web3 is <em class="italic">Crypto Jobs List</em>, a website dedicated to Web3 opportunities. It has a specific tab for data-related roles, accessible through this <span class="No-Break">link: </span><a href="https://cryptojobslist.com/data"><span class="No-Break">https://cryptojobslist.com/data</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Another excellent website is <em class="italic">Web3.career</em>, which offers a better filter for data science jobs: <a href="https://web3.career/data-science-jobs">https://web3.career/data-science-jobs</a>. An alternative option is <a href="https://www.web3creators.com/web3-jobs/data-analytics">https://www.web3creators.com/web3-jobs/data-analytics</a>. Traditional job engines such as AngelList and LinkedIn also post jobs, but their offerings are <span class="No-Break">more diverse.</span></p>
<p>Larger companies typically have a <strong class="old">Careers</strong> tab on their websites. For example, the Binance data department job search is posted at this link: https://www.binance.com/en/careers/department?name=Data%20%26%20Research&amp;job=. You can view Dune Analytics’ job page <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://dune.com/careers"><span class="No-Break">https://dune.com/careers</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Networking is another approach to exploring opportunities, though it might be a longer path. Posting on LinkedIn or Twitter, as previously described, can be effective. It is not unusual for a company you have researched to approach you and get in touch. Additionally, participating in learning sessions, which will be covered in the next section, can connect you with fellow data analysts who might recommend you <span class="No-Break">for opportun<a id="_idTextAnchor350"/>ities.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor351"/>Preparing for a job interview</h2>
<p>This is a brief<a id="_idIndexMarker723"/> section to reinforce the idea that thorough preparation using traditional data science resources, as outlined in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section, is highly advisable. The current Web3 ecosystem is predominantly composed of small and medium-sized companies seeking versatile data practitioners with a keen business sense and robust data science and <span class="No-Break">analytical skills.</span></p>
<p>The nature of our data interview experience will vary based on the applied job position and the company’s size. At a minimum, we can anticipate a technical (coding) challenge and a case study. The coding challenge assesses knowledge in areas such as data extraction, handling missing<a id="_idIndexMarker724"/> data, <strong class="old">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="old">ML</strong>) techniques, and Web3 database access. To prepare for the technical challenge, we can leverage online question lists, FAANG interview simulators, and Python and SQL skill challenges, among <span class="No-Break">other resources.</span></p>
<p>The case study<a id="_idIndexMarker725"/> involves discussing a strategy for solving a presented problem or providing recommendations for a specific scenario. Preparing for business questions necessitates researching the interviewing company, understanding its business case and services, and having a grasp of business and financial concepts. This preparation enhances effective communication with the interviewer and facilitates <span class="No-Break">collaborative problem-solving.</span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, where we showcase interviews with top Web3 data science experts, it becomes evident that they place significant importance on soft skills. Let’s explore some of these skills that are particularly relevant in the <span class="No-Break">Web3 landscape.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>Importance of soft skills</h2>
<p>Most blockchain<a id="_idIndexMarker726"/> companies embrace a remote-first culture, where teams from different locations work together toward common goals. In such environments, recruiters <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>value specific soft skills <span class="No-Break">in<a id="_idTextAnchor353"/> candidates:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="old">Ability to work independently</strong>: This skill means being able to work autonomously and accomplish tasks with minimal supervision and direction. The definition of a “job well done” is generally agreed upon with the manager and requires self-motivation, organization, planning, and problem-solving abilities. It also necessitates having a good working space and effective <span class="No-Break">communication skills.</span></li>
<li><strong class="old">Strong written communication</strong>: In a remote environment, most conversations occur in written form. Therefore, it is crucial to develop strong written <span class="No-Break">communication skills.</span></li>
<li><strong class="old">Comfortable with acquiring new skills</strong>: In remote work, managers often introduce new digital tools to streamline communication, work tracking, and other tasks. Being open to learning how to use these tools is important as they facilitate our daily work. Additionally, technology evolves continuously, impacting our work processes. With the advancement of models, it becomes feasible to execute simple queries through conversational chat (such as Dune, testing in Beta) or with drag-and-drop models (such as those Increment has built). However, our ability to learn new things and consistently search for value remains unchanged. By prioritizing value, we ensure that we always ask the right questions about <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></li>
<li><strong class="old">Team player</strong>: In a <a id="_idIndexMarker728"/>remote work environment, we tend to interact closely with those on our team, sometimes losing sight of other teams. It is<a id="_idIndexMarker729"/> essential to consciously connect with others and maintain a collaborative atmosphere. As team players, we must be accountable for our work, taking ownership of the consequences and rewards derived from the collective efforts of <span class="No-Break">our team.</span></li>
<li><strong class="old">Emotional intelligence (EI)</strong>: EI refers to our ability to understand and manage our<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> emotions in the workplace. The blockchain landscape can be volatile and filled with stress and anxiety, but it also offers moments of real creation, where products that did not exist before are developed, and as analysts, we get the chance to measure their impact for the first time. That is a great feeling. Assessing our EI is an introspective exercise, but some of the traits we need to excel at include being active listeners to our colleagues, being open to feedback, and handling emotions within the team <span class="No-Break">dynamic adeptly.</span></li>
<li><strong class="old">Agile methods</strong>: The way <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>of working in Web3 companies tends to be agile, which is based on flexibility, constant learning, and adaptability in self-organized teams. To achieve this, companies choose or test multiple methods to find the one that matches their culture. Methods such as Scrum, Kanban, and <strong class="old">objectives and key results</strong> (<strong class="old">OKRs</strong>) may<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> be part of the way companies th<a id="_idTextAnchor354"/>at we <span class="No-Break">join work.</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>Where to study</h1>
<p>Web3 data is<a id="_idIndexMarker733"/> experiencing rapid growth, and there are ample opportunities to explore this field. To accelerate your contributions, consider participating in training programs offered by various analytics companies. One highly recommended program is the <em class="italic">Data Alchemist</em> program, organized by the Covalent team. This program comprises four classes where a <a id="_idIndexMarker734"/>professor guides you through the dynamics and the latest <span class="No-Break">market trends.</span></p>
<p>Moreover, they extend invitations to all alchemists to join a Discord server, where technical queries find prompt answers and additional resources for further study are readily available. The syllabus typically covers a <a id="_idIndexMarker735"/>range of topics, including chain and multichain analysis, <strong class="old">decentralized exchange</strong> (<strong class="old">DEX</strong>), NFTs, <span class="No-Break">and loans.</span></p>
<p>In the last few years, there<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> have been other training programs, such as internships that have trained data scientists, so stay tuned for those companies to start those programs again. One example was the <a id="_idTextAnchor356"/><span class="No-Break">Dune-Resident program.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">A note on business impact</p>
<p class="callout">Working within a company, start-up, or any organization, we will encounter competing priorities, so it is crucial for the data practitioner to quantify the impact of any business data science project. In all roles within a company, including our own initiatives, we must be able to answer questions such as, “What is the estimated <strong class="old">return on investment</strong> (<strong class="old">ROI</strong>) for<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> our project?” and “What is the business impact of <span class="No-Break">our project?”</span></p>
<p class="callout">Firstly, to order priorities to have an impact, we can begin by analyzing business data science projects aligned with the company’s objectives. If we cannot identify the business objective supported by our project, it may need to be deprioritized. Once we find the objective, we can identify a business sponsor who will assist us in gathering relevant data, making connections, and <span class="No-Break">overcoming roadblocks.</span></p>
<p class="callout">Secondly, it is essential to <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>consider the <strong class="old">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="old">KPIs</strong>) that will measure the impact of our project. Will our project increase the number of <strong class="old">active users</strong> in the protocol we work on? Will the success of our project help our protocol increase our <strong class="old">market share</strong>? Will the project enhance the <strong class="old">quality</strong> of our service? Will the project improve the Web3 <strong class="old">experience</strong> for <span class="No-Break">our customers?</span></p>
<p class="callout">Thirdly, once we choose a metric, we need to estimate the percentage of impact we will have. Translating the impact of our projects into business language will help us lead <span class="No-Break">successful endeavors.</span></p>
<p class="callout">There are many guidelines to learn how to quantify the impact of business data science projects, and we list some resources in the <em class="italic">Further </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">rea<a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>ding</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section.</span></p>
