    or establishing our ventures. If you’ve acquired this book, it is because you
    recognize the potential to unlock value from blockchain data—value that the market

    to create solutions that contribute to the adoption of a more transparent system.
    According to Binance’s website ([https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/buidl](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/buidl)):
    “*BUIDL is a warping of the word “build” in the same fashion as “HODL.” BUIDL

    of any business data science project. In all roles within a company, including
