<p>The preceding diagram shows that learning extends beyond a combination of reading and hands-on practice; it also involves gaining insights from the experiences of professionals in <span class="No-Break">the field.</span></p>
<p>While this book has consistently integrated theory with practical exercises, there exists a third avenue of learning known as <em class="italic">learning through modeling</em>, which we aim to explore in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
<p>In the past, individuals pursuing a profession would apprentice under a master of that trade, someone who had the firsthand experience and could impart authentic knowledge. With this concept in mind, I have reached out to some of the leading minds in Web3 data science, seeking their perspectives on the past, present, and future of <span class="No-Break">the industry.</span></p>

<p class="author-quote">Data accessibility created a new job for me.</p>
<p>Hildobby is a data scientist at Dragonfly. His X (formerly Twitter) account can be found <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hildobby"><span class="No-Break">https://twitter.com/hildobby</span></a><span class="No-Break">_</span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Can you walk me through your career journey and highlight the most significant experience or role that has shaped your current expertise in the </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">crypto space?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Hildebert</strong>: Currently, I work at a venture firm called <strong class="old">Dragonfly</strong> (<a href="https://www.dragonfly.xyz/">https://www.dragonfly.xyz/</a>), which focuses on investing in crypto-related companies. I am a data scientist in the team, and I think I got there in a very unconventional way, which I’m pretty happy about. I’ll start now from what got me here. After my bachelor’s, I wanted to have some actionable experience in terms of what I want to do in the future, and so I had the occasion of joining a company called <strong class="old">Kaiko</strong>, which is a central exchange data company in crypto run by a family member. I got the chance to be hired, and at the beginning I was that annoying intern that you hire because I was the little cousin, but it ended up going very well and I really liked it. I also got to know a lot about the crypto space, and what drew me to keep being interested is definitely the <em class="italic">ethos</em> and the ideology of the whole ecosystem, the fact that anyone can contribute in their <span class="No-Break">own way.</span></p>
<p>When my parents convinced me to do a master’s degree instead of working straight away, I went abroad to Amsterdam. I did my master’s in computational science, which is basically modeling, and I got a job while studying in a dairy data company where the job was really interesting but the subject was not interesting to me, if that makes sense. The industry wasn’t the most fascinating to me. It is an extremely slow-paced industry; there’s not really anything happening, you know; it’s not exciting to me, <span class="No-Break">at least.</span></p>
<p>So, when the COVID lockdown hit, like a lot of people I got bored and I wanted to get back into crypto and I was like “how can I contribute in my own way or at least get to understand the whole thing better?” It was really about me understanding and <em class="italic">playing around first</em>. Then I found <strong class="old">Dune analytics</strong> (<a href="https://dune.com/home">https://dune.com/home</a>), where I did not need to run my own infrastructure, just worry about getting insights out of the data. I played around with Dune for probably around 9 months, sharing anonymously on Twitter (now X). I wanted to prove to myself that it was more about what I shared rather than who I am that is interesting. Eventually, some people started to reach out offering freelance jobs, and the more that happened the more I considered quitting my studies to go through this project full-time. It was a very hard decision as my family was very against it. I knew that if I did it I would go full in the project, and I was at a point where I had so many freelancing gigs that my whole week was already filled. I was making money, yes. It was also cool that Dune also supported me being a <em class="italic">Resident Wizard</em>, which is a program that started two years ago and that helped me basically be able to publish data without necessarily worrying about getting funding and gave me the freedom to focus on topics that no one would pay you directly to study but everyone is a bit interested in. For example, how does the entire market look in a sector, and similar questions. I enjoyed <span class="No-Break">that process.</span></p>
<p>I kept having some freelancing jobs, and then eventually I wanted to join a company to be able to do the same but without worrying about the organization, working with people on projects and worrying only about the data. A characteristic of the requests that I see in freelancing is that the company that pays for the analysis tends to be biased in what they want to see in the data, and I think that it’s hard to be objective when the money is directly involved in that aspect. So, I’m happy I got the chance to eventually join Dragonfly as a data scientist in July 2022, almost a year and a half ago. It is possible that your hobby can turn into a <span class="No-Break">full-time job.</span></p>
<p>Crypto is very powerful because it puts the individual in the spotlight rather than big companies that already have made a name for themselves; anyone, depending on their contribution, may have some impact in the space. <em class="italic">It doesn’t matter who you are or where you come from</em>. It is very powerful because you can become your own creator thanks to the fact that crypto takes transparency in data to another level; data is public and everything works with a different dynamic. And Dune is one part of it; data now can be looked into by anyone, and Dune makes it easy so that anyone can focus on extracting value from the data itself rather than needing to focus on the backend matters. Also, it has become a good place to search for crypto analysis in the same fashion as when looking for videos we go <span class="No-Break">to YouTube.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Do you consider data science for Web3 a niche? Will it remain that way or will crypto data expand to other use cases? What other parties do you see consuming our analysis in </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">the future?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Hildebert</strong>: I think crypto is at a point where it has plans to expand and is already very useful, maybe not in the conventional use case that you would have thought about in the first place but consider, for example, stablecoins. Stablecoins are a big solution for countries where it is not easy for people to have bank accounts or to protect from inflation. It enables a way to transact where there is no third party and it removes potential fees that are in force in the <span class="No-Break">current systems.</span></p>
<p>There is a lot of efficiency to be unlocked in the cryptocurrency industry versus the current systems, and I think we have reached a technology that has tons of potential but is currently in the same stage as the internet in the early 90s, where maybe we have no idea exactly what it is, but despite those first steps you notice the use. At that time, it was still possible to see people asking “why do I need email if I can send letters?” For some, it may feel that it is a fad and then eventually the industry will find its use cases, like today with social media, that is huge. I think it’s a technology that takes a while to understand and that we will see how it can help and there’s a lot of sectors that can <span class="No-Break">be helped.</span></p>
<p>Take another example, <strong class="old">Spindl</strong> (<a href="https://www.spindl.xyz/">https://www.spindl.xyz/</a>), which is one of the Dragonfly portfolio companies. I work with them quite closely, and I’m always excited about the new things they are developing. Today, blockchain advertising is very scammy, and that is because it is hard because there is no connection between Web2 and Web3, there is no service such as Google Ads that gives you a vision of how your ads performed, who you are targeting, what worked, and what did not. This information is very valuable to <span class="No-Break">the industry.</span></p>
<p>We are now building blocks that are needed in order for the expansion. It takes a while to get all these building blocks working as the foundation to finish the whole thing. I have no idea what in 10 years will be the next thing, but I don’t think anyone would have necessarily foreseen where we are now six years ago. I don’t think anyone predicts those kinds of waves coming in; they just happen when the technology <span class="No-Break">is mature.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: What developments in the crypto ecosystem have piqued your interest, particularly in terms of their potential to onboard the next </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">billion users?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Hildebert</strong>: In my opinion, it is not necessarily something specific but it’s broader and is part of the new concept of the whole system. Compared to the established systems, I think crypto has the potential to replace all those structures where, currently, <em class="italic">third parties</em> are needed. They will be abstracted or removed, and it will impact in terms of fees and costs, which have a tendency to be a race to the bottom, which makes sense because it is all about efficiency. At the end of the day, the user is the real winner because you end up with fees that are not absurd and because it is totally possible that someone will appear and take over with a better product or a less expensive one. This way, we improve competition. I think I am pretty happy <span class="No-Break">with this.</span></p>
<p>The other feature I want to highlight is the <em class="italic">cross-border</em> characteristic of crypto that really ties the world together. I guess international payments are a good example of what is a normal, frictionless service right now that may not be easy in some places, and this technology does help a lot in that regard. You know it is much cheaper to do international payments on crypto, and you don’t need anyone to approve receiving funds, as long as there is internet and a <span class="No-Break">wallet address.</span></p>
<p>The transparency of the data makes the competitive landscape much clearer because everything is done in a public manner and can be analyzed publicly, at least on public blockchains, and multiple competitors are coming in to see if there is some angle where previously someone could step in and be like “OK, well we think we can thrive with lower fees,” and everyone wins in <span class="No-Break">this place.</span></p>
<p>For this to really have an impact, education and regulation are necessary. I think well-regulated crypto would be awesome, and I think that we will get there eventually. In conclusion, I’m excited because of these two aspects, fees and <span class="No-Break">cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Considering the ongoing advancements in AI, there is a general feeling that AI is advancing over intellectual work. In your opinion, how do you think we should adapt to this progression and pivot? Most importantly, where do you see the emerging opportunities in this </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">changing landscape?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Hildebert</strong>: I think AI just brings in intellectual work to an equal footing. Each of us needs help in our own way, and that is what AI is doing. I think it makes you push whatever you’re doing further. Take data as an example. Now, for basic data analysis, you don’t necessarily need someone to look into it because AI is able to execute good models to comprehend it, and its output is reliable. Consequently, analysts can (now that this is tackled) go further and actually push research a step ahead. It is far from the place where I’m scared of it overtaking what I do because I think it just pushes us rather than <span class="No-Break">replaces us.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: If someone would like to work with you, what would you like to see on their profile? Soft skills (the ability to work independently, team player, emotional intelligence, agile methods) and hard skills (tools </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">and techniques)?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Hildebert</strong>: I think it is very important, especially with all the companies working remotely, that you have <em class="italic">independence.</em> I want to work with an independent person, I don’t want to need to constantly be behind someone because if it ends up taking away too much of my time we lose the discussion part. I want to discuss with you, I value when someone brings a challenge to what I know. I tend to really like people who don’t necessarily agree with me. It is what generates really good conversations, and I think it’s better than conversations where people agree with everything because you don’t necessarily get value out of it. This industry is less about big companies having egregious amounts of meetings working like an echo chamber, rather more about focusing on what everyone is delivering and on what each person can bring to <span class="No-Break">the table.</span></p>
<p>My advice is to focus on the work and the outputs rather than working hours or exactly monitoring everyone in a very standard Web 2.0 formal company way. I think what is cool is the individual and what this person brings to the table. I think we all have our skills and can bring something to the table, just like there’s different forms of intelligence, you know, some people are very good at writing, some people are really good at coding, some people are really good at sports, and everyone working together create <span class="No-Break">good products.</span></p>
<p>About hard skills, I value understanding what crypto is and the <em class="italic">industry</em>. You don’t understand the data until you understand what is behind the data. One industry is very different from the other, and what matters in one industry may not work in another. This is also why, when you make dashboards, you want to show first and foremost the things that are interesting. Understanding the market is maybe more important than coding or anything else. It will let you know if you can articulate what is most important and showcase <span class="No-Break">that first.</span></p>
<p>Storytelling is also important. When I look at dashboards, I expect to see what is most important. I should be able to assess how whatever I’m looking at is performing based on just one or two charts, and I can always dig further and further if I am interested in it. Good <em class="italic">presentation skills </em>are ideal for the data scientist because a lot of great work gets lost because it’s really badly presented, and there are many things that get pushed forward because people are really good at marketing but actually don’t have much substance in their work. So, in conclusion, for me, a good mixture of industry knowledge and presentation skills is <span class="No-Break">really necessary.</span></p>
<p>Something actionable for me when I am recruiting is that I couldn’t care less about your CV. What matters more to me is that you know what you bring to the table. And to create value, it is important to understand the technology and the blockchain space, and then you don’t just get there without practice. I think the best way to get there is to get started. If you’re interested, <em class="italic">you need to start</em>, and you will become an expert eventually. I think that if I look at the people I find successful in whichever industry, it’s people who try things, and very rarely do they succeed on the first try, but they keep trying. I want to work with people who I can say “I’ve seen your work and I find it interesting,” and it’s something I haven’t seen, or you bring something to the table clearly. This does not come from going to a really good school that not everyone has access to. Like I said, the whole crypto space puts us on an equal footing. Prove what value you create instead of showing me your <span class="No-Break">academic credentials.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: What recommendation do you have for someone who is learning more about data in Web3? And to someone that wants to migrate from another industry </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">to Web3?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Hildebert</strong>: Like I said before, try things. Trying new things usually leads to unlocking what people you have access to and who you are able to reach because they also care about what you are doing. In this space, people will be happy to help you when you ask interesting questions. When in this trying phase, I recommend reaching out to people (who you don’t necessarily have time to respond to), but if you are bringing something new to the table and have questions that are very insightful or interesting then they’re more likely to get <span class="No-Break">in contact.</span></p>
<p>Also, build a <em class="italic">reputation</em>, especially in crypto data; when I look at dashboards, I do not have the time to dig into everyone’s code and distinguish signal from noise, and it takes a while to build trust up. But if Michael Silberling (<a href="https://twitter.com/MSilb7">https://twitter.com/MSilb7</a>) or Chuxin (<a href="https://twitter.com/chuxin_h">https://twitter.com/chuxin_h</a>) publish something, I know they’ve won my trust because I’ve seen their work plenty of times and I know they follow best practices. In one of the chapters of this book, there is a recognition that there are still no solidified standards. This is true and the analyst has to be ready to iterate. Blockchain data is an iterative process, and we are currently at initial stages compared to what I imagine we can have in the next <span class="No-Break">few years.</span></p>
<p>Also, this highlights the importance of the whole preprocessing part because it gives insights just by cleaning the data. One thing I worked on last year was NFT trading and what the wash trading criteria (note from editor: this analysis is mentioned in <a href="B19446_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>) is. If you look at it in its raw form in trading, it is very sporadic in terms of activity, but if you manage to clean the organic activity and filter out that inorganic activity it is possible to end up with much cleaner data that has a lot more insights to be taken out. In this sense, there’s a lot of work to be done, probably a backlog of many years because there are so many avenues <span class="No-Break">to investigate.</span></p>
<p>I think <em class="italic">consistency</em> and reputation go hand in hand. It is necessary to continuously deliver sharp analysis because if you ship misleading or inaccurate data, your reputation takes a hit and I won’t trust you anymore. We all make mistakes. I have made many mistakes, but it is important to be transparent and say sorry and clarify when something was inaccurate and deliver a fixed version of it. No one has a perfect vision of everything; it’s an iterative process, but as long as you value transparency, we are good. This is a transparent system, and I think people in the system should be transparent. Users do not have the time to verify everything; with time, they eventually learn <span class="No-Break">to trust.</span></p>
<p>Our job is transforming what is <em class="italic">complex into simple</em> and, like I said before, a lot gets lost in too-high levels of complexity. To be able to simplify it, it is necessary to digest the data and really understand the complexity to be able to translate it. I will generally go from a high-level understanding and then scroll to go deeper and deeper. This is maybe the way because you can address everyone’s needs rather than going straight away to detail, as that may <span class="No-Break">get confusing.</span></p>
<p>For dashboards, the hook is very important, and that is composed of important data. The same thing happens with videos on YouTube. You are essentially stealing people’s time when they approach one of your dashboards and you want to make sure that it’s time well spent. If you do not work on your hook, they won’t stick around and watch all the stuff you publish. The hook is very important, and then you can always go deeper, but the reality is that 90% of people only want to see the high-level analysis, and then there are 10% that will go deeper, like to the operational level. How do we craft the best hook? It is an iterative process where I try slightly differently every time, and now it comes down to something extremely simple, like one sentence and then the main chart of what I’m trying to publish. The idea is that if the analyst wants to read more, they can go to the thread, but the idea is already very <span class="No-Break">simply presented.</span></p>

<p>Jackie Zhang’s role is of Developer Relations at Dune Analytics. Her LinkedIn can be found at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackieyingzhuzhang/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackieyingzhuzhang/</a> and her X (formerly Twitter) account is <a href="https://twitter.com/agaperste">https://twitter.com/agaperste</a>. She is also a host of the <em class="italic">Journey of the Unordinary</em> channel available <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="mailto:https://www.youtube.com/@JourneyofTheUnordinary"><span class="No-Break">https://www.youtube.com/@JourneyofTheUnordinary</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Can you walk me through your career journey and highlight the most significant experience or role that has shaped your current expertise in the </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">crypto space?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Jackie</strong>: I will start where I am now and reverse back to see how I reached here. My title is Developer Relations for Dune Analytics (<a href="https://dune.com/home">https://dune.com/home</a>). Dune is a crypto data company, so that is where the crypto comes in. Also, the company is composed of a small team, so I have the opportunity to think a lot about the product and how we sell and grow. I think you can already see the pattern of my interests about bridging crypto and data and also product and community. If you ask me to define myself, I am like a bridge builder, and I am quite happy with <span class="No-Break">this role.</span></p>
<p>Going back to what led me to where I am, at college I studied computer science and finance, and after college I worked as a software developer for Deutsche Bank. I quickly realized that I wanted to be a bridge, even in the software developer role. I was good at connecting the internal users and bridging the gap between the requirement and the code. There is another aspect in that it led me to think “This is what I want to do,” and it is more personal because for a long time I did not think about that <span class="No-Break">at all.</span></p>
<p>I came to the US from very traditional Chinese parents who give you guidance about what you should do, and even though I wanted to study international relations, they suggested computer science because it is much easier to get hired with computer science. I did it, but I still was having visa problems after almost 10 years of living in the US. So, I was facing this visa issue and I was either going to be sent by my company to London basically, or I had to do something else. So I decided to go back to grad school. I already knew that I wanted to transition more to something different from software development. I chose data science, which is closer to the business side, and then after graduation I took a regular data science job at Fidelity. Truth be told, I did a lot of web development stuff that one year and while I <span class="No-Break">was there.</span></p>
<p>I was lucky to have met my husband, and I solved my visa issue through our marriage. Then I felt for the first time I had the freedom to think about what I really wanted to do. I don’t really know how to question myself too much about what I want to do or what I am passionate about. So, I solved it by saying <em class="italic">“OK I’ll just see where I end up spending the most time”</em>. This is where crypto interest started. It was already a theme, and I would spend a lot of time looking deeper into it, exploring. This is the place where all my free time went, and I realized that I have never really felt an attraction like this. At first, I just wanted to do it, and then eventually I had to be in crypto full-time. Something that really excited me was the promise of being able to distribute the resources in the world better. I have this drive inside of me about the crypto ideology, but at the same time I like using crypto data that is open and can generate benefits to make it fairer. Having the technical skills has enabled me to transition and have a role in the business to which I am attracted by its <em class="italic">ethos</em>. It is an ideology, and then I realized I was happy <span class="No-Break">doing it.</span></p>
<p>I think the current way of finding a job is already slowly changing. It’s no longer like “oh, I send a resume and go through the traditional pipeline.” Rather, you start working for the protocol and eventually <span class="No-Break">get hired.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Do you consider Web3 data science a niche? Will it remain that way, or will crypto data expand to other use cases? What other parties do you see consuming our analysis in </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">the future?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Jackie</strong>: OK, the first question is super easy: we are currently working in a niche. The second question, the short answer is only time will tell. Frederick (Dune’s CEO) actually mentioned this matter at the DuneCon, when he cited Steve <span class="No-Break">Jobs’ quote:</span></p>
<p class="author-quote">“...people ask me, “Why should I buy a computer in my home?”</p>
<p class="author-quote">…well, to learn about it, to run fun simulations.</p>
<p class="author-quote">…but other than that, there’s no good reason to buy one for your house right now.</p>
<p class="author-quote">But there will be. There will be.”</p>

<p>Time will tell, I hope it will. I think people in this industry like you have conviction, but your conviction is always a leap of faith. But I’m already seeing real data in that direction. I don’t know the future, but if I zoom out in perspective, I think the Bitcoin ETF is a real thing. I don’t think we have mentioned adoption, but more people are hearing about it, and last year, the perception was more negative; now, maybe it’s more neutral. How it could be adopted in the future is through advertisement, performance marketing, and what Spindl (<a href="https://www.spindl.xyz/">https://www.spindl.xyz/</a>) is doing. I’m excited to see more of what <span class="No-Break">they do.</span></p>
<p>Web2 is super closed doors, and even though there are many things that should be kept private, I think we could do so much more to come up with solutions in this landscape. If we can abstract from the underlying technology of what is complicated, like blockchain, and maybe move on towards what consumers want in an app where technology is transparent for them, I think it <span class="No-Break">will expand.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: What developments in the crypto ecosystem have piqued your interest, particularly in terms of their potential to onboard the next </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">billion users?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Jackie</strong>: Basically, we don’t know, and there are a lot of endeavors looking for that answer. I still think we are in an early stage because when you think about it, to adopt a product two factors come into play. You need to have the motivation to do it and then you need to have the ability to <span class="No-Break">do it.</span></p>
<p>I think that, today, we are in a world where blockchain is being used as a store of value in highly inflationary countries or as a means of cross-border payment for sanctioned countries, but aside from that there is no other motivation for you to go through all the trouble that crypto is nowadays. I see smart people coming early into this space to try to arbitrage like money or traders. I also read about options traders and how crypto just enables them to do it so much easier than before. Even with open data, we are still not democratizing the opportunities that these very smart people wouldn’t have had beforehand, so I’m really bullish on these ideas, but I’m not sure these extremely motivated and able people represent the next 1 billion users, many of whom struggle with their own lives, their next meal, and so on. In conclusion, I see the solution to onboard the next billion users related to everyday problems. It is not related to a new feature or something like that, rather the service has to solve everyday problems <span class="No-Break">for people.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Considering the ongoing advancements in AI, there is a general feeling that AI is advancing over intellectual work. In your opinion, how do you think we should adapt to this progression and pivot? Most importantly, where do you see the emerging opportunities in this </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">changing landscape?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Jackie</strong>: I think that until we have general artificial intelligence where robots are truly taking over the world, I don’t think we have anything to worry about as we are a very <em class="italic">adaptive species</em>. If you think about it, at the beginning people couldn’t write, right? So, scribes had a lot of work, but then everyone learned to read and write and scribes were not needed, but other jobs appeared. Another example is women, who would spend so much time washing clothes, and then the washing machine was invented and women started adding value to the market massively. I just think it’s going to be fine. In the short-term vision, we still need a lot of analysts writing good SQL to train the AI. Take, for example, Dune AI, you need people to be able to write good queries and then to feed them into this model and evaluate if the result is correct. So yeah, I think in the short term there’s plenty of need for people who write SQL, and then once we get to the point where we don’t need people writing SQL, then people who have blockchain data knowledge are going to be fine because then everybody will need to extract the insights from the data, and so on so forth. Just like everybody can read nowadays, the same process will happen with SQL. And humanity will move to the next level. I think we will be completely fine, better and <span class="No-Break">more efficient.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: If someone would like to work with you, what would you like to see on their profile? Soft skills (the ability to work independently, team player, emotional intelligence, agile methods) and hard skills (tools </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">and techniques)?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Jackie</strong>: On the soft skill part, I think the other side of independence is like <em class="italic">dependency</em>. This is that the person will show up and that you can trust. I will trust them if they do what they say they will do. Also, <em class="italic">inner drive</em> is important. You can’t really assess passion or something, but the drive to get things done, because it is an indicator that they are interested in it. Another soft skill is <em class="italic">communication</em>, basic communication, but also the cross-functioning ability, like being able to talk to different people, to different departments, and trying to get everybody working together. You have to be able to make sure that everybody understands each other and then what needs to be delivered, the direction to go, and how to influence people so that they will come with you. It is like leadership anchored in communication. The <em class="italic">ability to learn</em>, the curiosity and ability to learn because you can always try <span class="No-Break">new things.</span></p>
<p>In the hard skills, I would add <em class="italic">data savviness</em>, which means knowing what questions to ask, and I think that comes through experience. And then the regular skills, like SQL, Python, and industry knowledge, which is pretty standard. It is important to develop soft skills as you can always learn <span class="No-Break">new things.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: What recommendation do you have for someone who is learning about data in Web3? And to someone that wants to migrate from another industry </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">to Web3?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Jackie</strong>: I feel like we’ve already mentioned this, but just do it, just go for it. Interest comes really as a natural flow, just one after another. Don’t force yourself <span class="No-Break">into it.</span></p>
<p>Also, you need to be consistent. The reason Andrew, Hildobby, and Coby are big and still continue to be big is because they always turn out valuable content. They don’t just do one hit and <span class="No-Break">then leave.</span></p>
<p>Also, specifically for people going to Web3 coming from Web2, I would recommend focusing on learning the crypto knowledge because the analytical skills will be enough to perform well on Web3. Data maturity in the space is still not there, so whatever they already have in terms of technical analytical skills is probably enough. I would like people from Web2 with more experience to come into Web3 to make the space more mature because I don’t think we have enough people and there is so much to do. This is an invitation, please come over. This world is so open, there is so much that can be done, and it is very friendly. Imagine that in this space there are big, interconnected teams trying to solve this problem together with you, versus a lot of Web2 companies where there is a team of 5 data people, each one focused on their own thing. Also, in Web3, once you’re done you start building on top of what others have built. This idea of composability is <span class="No-Break">very present.</span></p>
<p>Simple and concise dashboards are very important. Most times, users look at 1 or 2 charts and they leave, right? It is the same reaction to a 30-minute PowerPoint presentation. How much can they really take away if it’s not just about the data? Focus on making the takeaway super simple statistics. They have to be simple or the message will <span class="No-Break">get lost.</span></p>

<p class="author-quote">Whether you are curious and want to explore resources, or are embarking on a full-on career change, you don’t have to navigate this alone!</p>
<p>Marina is a Community Relations consultant at <strong class="old">Flipside Crypto</strong> and a board member and contributor at <strong class="old">MetricsDAO</strong>. Her X (formerly Twitter) account <span class="No-Break">is </span><span class="No-Break">https://twitter.com/queriesdata</span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Can you walk me through your career journey and highlight the most significant experience or role that has shaped your current expertise in the crypto space? Please start with a short description of your </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">current role.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Marina</strong>: In my work, I support data analysts in the blockchain analytics community as they grow their skills, produce open source insights that are valuable for Web3, and turn their skillset and passion into fulfilling careers. The fact that Web3 data, unlike data in Web2, is not proprietary or paywalled, creates a unique way for anyone to engage with it. The result is an ecosystem of enthusiasts and professionals that has emerged around on-chain data. That is exactly how I started down this path: by coming across this ecosystem, becoming one of this community’s analytics enthusiasts myself, and making lots <span class="No-Break">of dashboards!</span></p>
<p>Open source blockchain data analysis can lend itself to considerable upward (or lateral if you are switching industries) mobility. An individual who is curious about blockchains and is interested in picking up entry-level data analysis skills to start will find themselves with essentially unlimited topics to explore, while expertise gets progressively more sophisticated. Learning how to work with real-time data that describes real Web3 start-ups and communities can feel vastly more rewarding than downloading a mock or frequently used public dataset for practice. Early on, you start to create tangible value: find insights that can help a protocol in their business decisions, inform conversations around allocating capital, and help communities understand their favorite protocol better. Impact is helpful for someone to demonstrate in their job application when breaking into a Web3 data career, or a data-adjacent role in areas such as product, customer, or community success. But it also creates value transfers in the meantime, where Web3 projects compensate community analysts for created value – think freelance requests, retroactive grants, and analytics bounty and <span class="No-Break">rewards programs.</span></p>
<p>I got deeper into the industry and more passionate about it by participating in things like these! (Except retroactive grants, which are on the bucket list as something I haven’t yet received as an individual, only as part of a <strong class="old">Decentralized Autonomous Organization</strong> (<strong class="old">DAO</strong>) team). Now, I’ve ended up working with organizations like Flipside and MetricsDAO with which I first had a lot of touchpoints as a Web3 analyst <span class="No-Break">community member.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Do you consider Web3 data science a niche? Will it remain that way or will crypto data expand to other use cases? What other parties do you see consuming our analysis in </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">the future?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Marina</strong>: It is a large enough niche to feel all-consuming when you are a part of it! In all seriousness, I think an interesting crossover is <strong class="old">Real-World Assets</strong> (<strong class="old">RWA</strong>). Now that companies like Nike and Starbucks are adding a Web3 component to their business model, anyone can look at on-chain data at how successful that part of their business is (and these companies in turn need crypto data experts). Sports is another use case: a dedicated fan can go from trying to gauge the value of their physical trading card collection to looking at on-chain data for what their sports NFT collectible is worth. Gaming with in-game purchases is another industry that has embraced crypto, and by extension can gain many insights through <span class="No-Break">blockchain data.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: What developments in the crypto ecosystem have piqued your interest, particularly in terms of their potential to onboard the next </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">billion users?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Marina</strong>: I shared my take on this topic recently on the Flipside blog (<a href="https://data.flipsidecrypto.com/blog/new-kid-on-base-network-effects-could-onboard-the-next-billion-into-web3">https://data.flipsidecrypto.com/blog/new-kid-on-base-network-effects-could-onboard-the-next-billion-into-web3</a>)! To aid the crypto ecosystem’s ambitious user onboarding goals, I think multipliers and network effects are what will create faster-than-linear growth. SocialFi helped Base onboard many users recently, not unlike the social networks of Web2, where you would join to follow your early-adopter friend, then more of your friends would sign up to follow you, and so on. Another multiplier is developers: protocols that focus on onboarding developers and a great developer experience will see some of those builders create apps that take off and bring on large groups of users. Projects that aim to become quotidian financial alternatives in less stable economic environments too have the potential of tapping into a network effect. For instance, a migrant worker who sends home a remittance in stablecoins will onboard their recipients <span class="No-Break">onto Web3.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Considering the ongoing advancements in AI, there is a general feeling that AI is advancing over intellectual work. Do you agree? In your opinion, how do you think we should adapt to this progression and pivot? Most importantly, where do you see the emerging opportunities in this </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">changing landscape?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Marina</strong>: For example, AI can help you fix your SQL query, but it can also help you learn a new coding language or library that you will then use. Programming aside, interpreting and drawing conclusions from blockchain data is one of the aspects that is very nuanced and therefore lends itself well to a human mind. Crypto data outputs are far from sufficiently standardized, and even after this aspect improves in the future, drawing data-driven meaning requires plenty of context (which typically <span class="No-Break">needs people).</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: If someone would like to work with you, what would you like to see on their profile? Soft skills (the ability to work independently, team player, emotional intelligence, agile methods) and hard skills (tools </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">and techniques)?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Marina</strong>: I will answer this for someone looking to break into blockchain data analysis. First, building one’s base of technical skills for data analytics (and related fields such as data science or analytics engineering) is a well-resourced endeavor in this day and age. There exist resources (many of them free) in written, video, social media, and interactive formats, and they provide lists of skills as well as learning and practice materials that help gain them. A more elusive, but totally achievable, strength is to establish your voice and profile as someone who digs deep and produces quality Web3 insights, and foster your network and community (or even an audience) who find these insights interesting and useful, engage in conversations about them, bring requests, and offer feedback. Being actively embedded in communities and understanding data questions and needs is what sets apart an impactful Web3 analyst. This involves a mix of curiosity, being professional and friendly, and putting in the effort into being attuned to Web3 and its niches and projects, relationship-building, having conversations, and constantly thinking about what data-driven questions one can answer to bring value to <span class="No-Break">the table.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: And to someone who wants to migrate from another industry </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">to Web3?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Marina</strong>: Whether you are curious and want to explore resources or are embarking on a full-on career change, you don’t have to navigate this alone! Surround yourself with the community instead. This will help with many aspects of your journey, from finding resources to getting answers to your questions, meeting others in similar stages of familiarity with Web3 data, and building a network of peers and experienced blockchain data professionals. Luckily, there are already multiple specialized communities. You will find resources and a community around your crypto data tool or provider of choice (like Flipside); MetricsDAO is a tool-agnostic hub with many on-chain data professionals and enthusiasts and learning resources; Crypto Data Bytes on Substack offers a wealth of educational materials; and there also exist communities of crypto analysts who publish their work, like OurNetwork. Reading is a great way to find inspiration and meet data professionals. Bring your curiosity and friendliness, and you will find yourself in a community that supports <span class="No-Break">your growth.</span></p>

<p class="author-quote">A blockchain is not a traditional database. Analysts don’t write to it or correct it.</p>
<p>Professor One Digit is a data scientist at <strong class="old">Sovryn</strong>. His X (formerly Twitter) account can be found <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://twitter.com/onedigitmoney"><span class="No-Break">https://twitter.com/onedigitmoney</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Can you walk me through your career journey and highlight the most significant experience or role that has shaped your current expertise in the crypto space? Please start with a short description of your </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">current role.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Professor One Digit</strong>: I am currently in the role of a data analyst as well as technical communicator for Sovryn. These two things go together, as each part of the role informs the other. I came into this role in an unusual way. I spent over 30 years in academia as an engineering professor before joining Sovryn, where I evolved into my current role from a purely technical communication role. I am very comfortable with high-level math, mathematical modeling, and programming. I’m also experienced as a technical communicator. The specifics of my current role are quite different from my previous career experience, but that general background gave me the foundation and confidence to evolve into <span class="No-Break">this role.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Will it remain that way or will crypto data expand to other use cases? What other parties do you see consuming our analysis in </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">the future?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Professor One Digit</strong>: I don’t have a fully developed opinion on this. My general perspective is that crypto data analysis isn’t fundamentally different from other data analysis. On-chain analysis has opened up a new area of application for data analysis and has stimulated a lot of creative metrics for analysis. However, the methods are similar to more traditional analysis. I can see crypto analysis taking on a larger role for on-chain forensics as well as analysis for trading and <span class="No-Break">investing decisions.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: What developments in the crypto ecosystem have piqued your interest, particularly in terms of their potential to onboard the next </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">billion users?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Professor One Digit</strong>: I am very interested in rollups on Bitcoin that can use methods like BitVM, witness encryption, or proof-of-stake second layers to trustlessly peg Bitcoin into a more flexible layer on top of Bitcoin. This could well be a solution to the <span class="No-Break">scaling problem.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: Considering the ongoing advancements in AI, there is a general feeling that AI is advancing over intellectual work. Do you agree? In your opinion, how do you think we should adapt to this progression and pivot? Most importantly, where do you see the emerging opportunities in this </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">changing landscape?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Professor One Digit</strong>: It makes it easier to figure out syntax or debug code, but that can sometimes free me to approach high-level issues without getting bogged down in the details. One area that could benefit from AI would be the ability to analyze a code base and describe the function of the system or to be able to answer questions about it. Another would be to identify vulnerabilities that are not evident on a first-order understanding of the <span class="No-Break">code function.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: If someone would like to work with you, what would you like to see on their profile? Soft skills (the ability to work independently, team player, emotional intelligence, agile methods) and hard skills (tools </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">and techniques)?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Professor One Digit</strong>: Along with that would be the ability and willingness to tackle new problems and use new tools that aren’t familiar <span class="No-Break">to them.</span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Gabriela: And to someone who wants to migrate from another industry </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old">to Web3?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong class="old">Professor One Digit</strong>: You have to know something about the motivation and culture of Web3. This means understanding why we are pursuing decentralization, permission-lessness, etc. Otherwise, it is hard to understand or appreciate the data and what it means. Understanding the basic idea and structure of a blockchain is a must. A blockchain is not a traditional database. Analysts don’t write to it or correct it. Anyone who goes into this area should also learn about the subcultures and attitudes of Bitcoin versus Ethereum versus other altcoins. You need to work in an area that aligns with your philosophy about what is good for the world and where it is likely to go. Take your time and find a project you believe will change the world for the better, not just one that will pay your salary while you do <span class="No-Break">cool things.</span></p>

<p>Here’s an analysis column by column of the Dune Analytics <strong class="source-inline">nft.trade</strong> table with additional comments to those of the documentation connected with the sale of Bored Ape #6633 analyzed in <a href="B19446_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>. (source: <a href="https://dune.com/docs/data-tables/spellbook/top-tables/nft.trades/#column-data">https://dune.com/docs/data-tables/spellbook/top-tables/nft.trades/#column-data</a><span class="hidden"> </span><span class="No-Break">and </span><a href="https://dune.com/queries/3268989"><span class="No-Break">https://dune.com/queries/3268989</span></a><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="source-inline">block_time</strong>: The timestamp of the block where the transaction <span class="No-Break">was added.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">nft_token_id</strong>: The ID of the token that is being transferred. In the case we analyzed in the notebook, the number would <span class="No-Break">be </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">6633</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">erc_standard</strong>: The standard followed by the smart contract, denoting how the project was structured. This can be <strong class="bold">ERC 20</strong>, <strong class="bold">ERC 721</strong>, or <strong class="bold">ERC 1155</strong>. The table also shows a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">SuperRare</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> standard.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">platform</strong>: The column will show the marketplace where the trade <span class="No-Break">was made.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">platform_version</strong>: Some marketplaces evolved with time and changed their smart contracts. The way to query information and the functions may vary depending on the version of <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">trade_type</strong>: According to the documentation, this table indexes three types <span class="No-Break">of trades:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Single Item Trade</strong>: Where a single transaction contains a <span class="No-Break">single item.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Bundle Trade</strong>: Where a single transaction contains <span class="No-Break">multiple items.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Aggregator Trade</strong>: Where in a single transaction there is a transfer of multiple items from various marketplaces <span class="No-Break">at once.</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">But when querying the data, we see that the column refers to the primary or <span class="No-Break">secondary sales:</span></p></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">category</strong>: The category of activity performed by the smart contract ranging from auctions to <span class="No-Break">traditional sales.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">nft_project_name</strong>: The name of the NFT project in a human-readable style; for example, Bored Ape Yacht Club <span class="No-Break">or CryptoPunks.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">evt_type</strong>: In the case of Bored Ape 6633, it will be <strong class="source-inline">trade</strong>. The options in this table are <strong class="source-inline">trade</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">redeem</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">mint</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">swap</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">usd_amount</strong>: The price paid in the transaction. The price is the result of multiplying the quantity of the transferred currency (for example, ETH/USDT) by the market price at the moment of the transfer. According to the Dune documentation, the market price is sourced from <span class="No-Break">third-party databases.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">seller</strong>: The seller of the piece of art on the marketplace. In the case of Bored Ape 6633, the seller had the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">0xde2…06ef</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> address.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">buyer</strong>: The buyer of the piece of art on the marketplace. In the case of Bored Ape 6633, the buyer had the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">0xb4…cb57</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> address.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">original_amount</strong>: The price paid expressed in the token/currency amount in which it was transacted. In the case we are following, it was ETH. This value is decoded, meaning that it is translated from the format that was originally <span class="No-Break">reflected on-chain.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">original_amount_raw</strong>: The price paid but without decoding <span class="No-Break">the decimals.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">currency_symbol</strong>: The currency or token used to generate <span class="No-Break">the transaction.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">original_currency_contract</strong>: The contract of the currency or token used. This is very useful when searching for transfers of tokens on ERC-20 tokens. For example, if the payment for an NFT sale is done using USDT or DOC, we will need to search for a transfer in the USDT or DOC smart contracts logs. Within the logs, we will find movement between the two <span class="No-Break">involved addresses.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">currency_contract</strong>: This is relevant when the currency is wrapped to be used in the exchange. For example, for Ethereum, the wrapped contract is WETH and the contract <span class="No-Break">is </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">xc02…6cc2</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">project_contract_address</strong>: This is the collection contract address that, in combination with the token ID, will provide uniqueness to a non-fungible item. In the case of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, it will be <strong class="source-inline">0xbc…f13d</strong>, as we saw at the beginning of <a href="B19446_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">aggregator_name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">aggregator_address</strong>: These columns are empty in the transfer under analysis. They include the addresses of the aggregators in case any of them participate in <span class="No-Break">the trade.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">exchange_contract_address</strong>: The address of the marketplace where the transaction took place. In the case of the collectible that we are following on the notebook, the marketplace is OpenSea and the address is <strong class="source-inline">0x7b…d12b</strong>. These smart contracts handle the transfer and payment of collectibles listed on <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">tx_hash</strong>: The transaction hash of <span class="No-Break">the sale.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">block_number</strong>: The block number in which the transaction <span class="No-Break">was included.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">tx_from</strong>: The initiator of the transaction. In the case of the sale of Bored Ape 6633, it is <span class="No-Break">the buyer.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">tx_to</strong>: The recipient of the transaction. In the case of a sale within a marketplace, it is the exchange smart contract that receives the transaction and activates the relevant functions to execute the sale. In the case under analysis, it is the OpenSea <span class="No-Break">exchange address.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">royalty_fees_percent</strong>: Royalty fees going to the creator (in %). In the case of the sale of Bored Ape 6633, it <span class="No-Break">is 2%.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">royalty_fees_amount</strong>: Royalty fees in the currency used for this trade. In the case under analysis, it is <span class="No-Break">3.99975 WETH.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">royalty_fee_amount_usd</strong>: USD value of royalty fees at the time of execution. In this case, it is <span class="No-Break">USD 12,929.991825.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">platform_fees_percent</strong>: Platform fees (in %). In this case, it is also 2%, the same as <span class="No-Break">the royalties.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">platform_fees_amount</strong>: Platform fees in the currency used for this trade, so the amount is <span class="No-Break">3.99975 WETH.</span></li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">platform_fees_usd</strong>: USD value of platform fees at the time of execution. The amount is <span class="No-Break">USD 12,929.991825.</span></li>
