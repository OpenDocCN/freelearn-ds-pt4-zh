    in the team, and I think I got there in a very unconventional way, which I’m pretty
    happy about. I’ll start now from what got me here. After my bachelor’s, I wanted
    to have some actionable experience in terms of what I want to do in the future,
    and so I had the occasion of joining a company called **Kaiko**, which is a central
    exchange data company in crypto run by a family member. I got the chance to be
    hired, and at the beginning I was that annoying intern that you hire because I
    was the little cousin, but it ended up going very well and I really liked it.
    I also got to know a lot about the crypto space, and what drew me to keep being
    interested is definitely the *ethos* and the ideology of the whole ecosystem,
    the fact that anyone can contribute in their own way.'

    where the job was really interesting but the subject was not interesting to me,
    if that makes sense. The industry wasn’t the most fascinating to me. It is an
    extremely slow-paced industry; there’s not really anything happening, you know;
    it’s not exciting to me, at least.

    to get back into crypto and I was like “how can I contribute in my own way or
    at least get to understand the whole thing better?” It was really about me understanding
    and *playing around first*. Then I found **Dune analytics** ([https://dune.com/home](https://dune.com/home)),
    where I did not need to run my own infrastructure, just worry about getting insights
    out of the data. I played around with Dune for probably around 9 months, sharing
    anonymously on Twitter (now X). I wanted to prove to myself that it was more about
    what I shared rather than who I am that is interesting. Eventually, some people
    started to reach out offering freelance jobs, and the more that happened the more
    I considered quitting my studies to go through this project full-time. It was
    a very hard decision as my family was very against it. I knew that if I did it
    I would go full in the project, and I was at a point where I had so many freelancing
    gigs that my whole week was already filled. I was making money, yes. It was also
    cool that Dune also supported me being a *Resident Wizard*, which is a program
    that started two years ago and that helped me basically be able to publish data
    without necessarily worrying about getting funding and gave me the freedom to
    focus on topics that no one would pay you directly to study but everyone is a
    bit interested in. For example, how does the entire market look in a sector, and
    similar questions. I enjoyed that process.

    company to be able to do the same but without worrying about the organization,
    working with people on projects and worrying only about the data. A characteristic
    of the requests that I see in freelancing is that the company that pays for the
    analysis tends to be biased in what they want to see in the data, and I think
    that it’s hard to be objective when the money is directly involved in that aspect.
    So, I’m happy I got the chance to eventually join Dragonfly as a data scientist
    in July 2022, almost a year and a half ago. It is possible that your hobby can
    turn into a full-time job.

    than big companies that already have made a name for themselves; anyone, depending
    on their contribution, may have some impact in the space. *It doesn’t matter who
    you are or where you come from*. It is very powerful because you can become your
    own creator thanks to the fact that crypto takes transparency in data to another
    level; data is public and everything works with a different dynamic. And Dune
    is one part of it; data now can be looked into by anyone, and Dune makes it easy
    so that anyone can focus on extracting value from the data itself rather than
    needing to focus on the backend matters. Also, it has become a good place to search
    for crypto analysis in the same fashion as when looking for videos we go to YouTube.

    Stablecoins are a big solution for countries where it is not easy for people to
    have bank accounts or to protect from inflation. It enables a way to transact
    where there is no third party and it removes potential fees that are in force

    where maybe we have no idea exactly what it is, but despite those first steps
    you notice the use. At that time, it was still possible to see people asking “why
    do I need email if I can send letters?” For some, it may feel that it is a fad
    and then eventually the industry will find its use cases, like today with social
    media, that is huge. I think it’s a technology that takes a while to understand

    where, currently, *third parties* are needed. They will be abstracted or removed,
    and it will impact in terms of fees and costs, which have a tendency to be a race
    to the bottom, which makes sense because it is all about efficiency. At the end
    of the day, the user is the real winner because you end up with fees that are
    not absurd and because it is totally possible that someone will appear and take
    over with a better product or a less expensive one. This way, we improve competition.

    crypto that really ties the world together. I guess international payments are
    a good example of what is a normal, frictionless service right now that may not
    be easy in some places, and this technology does help a lot in that regard. You
    know it is much cheaper to do international payments on crypto, and you don’t
    need anyone to approve receiving funds, as long as there is internet and a wallet
    address.

    everything is done in a public manner and can be analyzed publicly, at least on

    we can thrive with lower fees,” and everyone wins in this place.

    everything because you don’t necessarily get value out of it. This industry is

    You don’t understand the data until you understand what is behind the data. One
    industry is very different from the other, and what matters in one industry may
    not work in another. This is also why, when you make dashboards, you want to show
    first and foremost the things that are interesting. Understanding the market is
    maybe more important than coding or anything else. It will let you know if you
    can articulate what is most important and showcase that first.

    is most important. I should be able to assess how whatever I’m looking at is performing
    based on just one or two charts, and I can always dig further and further if I
    am interested in it. Good *presentation skills* are ideal for the data scientist
    because a lot of great work gets lost because it’s really badly presented, and
    there are many things that get pushed forward because people are really good at
    marketing but actually don’t have much substance in their work. So, in conclusion,
    for me, a good mixture of industry knowledge and presentation skills is really
    necessary.

    about your CV. What matters more to me is that you know what you bring to the
    table. And to create value, it is important to understand the technology and the
    blockchain space, and then you don’t just get there without practice. I think
    the best way to get there is to get started. If you’re interested, *you need to
    start*, and you will become an expert eventually. I think that if I look at the
    people I find successful in whichever industry, it’s people who try things, and
    very rarely do they succeed on the first try, but they keep trying. I want to
    work with people who I can say “I’ve seen your work and I find it interesting,”
    and it’s something I haven’t seen, or you bring something to the table clearly.
    This does not come from going to a really good school that not everyone has access
    to. Like I said, the whole crypto space puts us on an equal footing. Prove what
    value you create instead of showing me your academic credentials.

    I do not have the time to dig into everyone’s code and distinguish signal from

    something, I know they’ve won my trust because I’ve seen their work plenty of
    times and I know they follow best practices. In one of the chapters of this book,
    there is a recognition that there are still no solidified standards. This is true

    at it in its raw form in trading, it is very sporadic in terms of activity, but
    if you manage to clean the organic activity and filter out that inorganic activity
    it is possible to end up with much cleaner data that has a lot more insights to
    be taken out. In this sense, there’s a lot of work to be done, probably a backlog
    of many years because there are so many avenues to investigate.'

    have made many mistakes, but it is important to be transparent and say sorry and
    clarify when something was inaccurate and deliver a fixed version of it. No one
    has a perfect vision of everything; it’s an iterative process, but as long as
    you value transparency, we are good. This is a transparent system, and I think
    people in the system should be transparent. Users do not have the time to verify
    everything; with time, they eventually learn to trust.

    to translate it. I will generally go from a high-level understanding and then

    data. The same thing happens with videos on YouTube. You are essentially stealing
    people’s time when they approach one of your dashboards and you want to make sure
    that it’s time well spent. If you do not work on your hook, they won’t stick around
    and watch all the stuff you publish. The hook is very important, and then you
    can always go deeper, but the reality is that 90% of people only want to see the
    high-level analysis, and then there are 10% that will go deeper, like to the operational
    level. How do we craft the best hook? It is an iterative process where I try slightly
    differently every time, and now it comes down to something extremely simple, like
    one sentence and then the main chart of what I’m trying to publish. The idea is
    that if the analyst wants to read more, they can go to the thread, but the idea
    is already very simply presented.

    be kept private, I think we could do so much more to come up with solutions in
    this landscape. If we can abstract from the underlying technology of what is complicated,
    like blockchain, and maybe move on towards what consumers want in an app where
    technology is transparent for them, I think it will expand.

    of value in highly inflationary countries or as a means of cross-border payment
    for sanctioned countries, but aside from that there is no other motivation for
    you to go through all the trouble that crypto is nowadays. I see smart people
    coming early into this space to try to arbitrage like money or traders. I also
    read about options traders and how crypto just enables them to do it so much easier
    than before. Even with open data, we are still not democratizing the opportunities
    that these very smart people wouldn’t have had beforehand, so I’m really bullish
    on these ideas, but I’m not sure these extremely motivated and able people represent
    the next 1 billion users, many of whom struggle with their own lives, their next
    meal, and so on. In conclusion, I see the solution to onboard the next billion
    users related to everyday problems. It is not related to a new feature or something
    like that, rather the service has to solve everyday problems for people.

    people couldn’t write, right? So, scribes had a lot of work, but then everyone
    learned to read and write and scribes were not needed, but other jobs appeared.
    Another example is women, who would spend so much time washing clothes, and then
    the washing machine was invented and women started adding value to the market
    massively. I just think it’s going to be fine. In the short-term vision, we still
    need a lot of analysts writing good SQL to train the AI. Take, for example, Dune
    AI, you need people to be able to write good queries and then to feed them into
    this model and evaluate if the result is correct. So yeah, I think in the short
    term there’s plenty of need for people who write SQL, and then once we get to
    the point where we don’t need people writing SQL, then people who have blockchain
    data knowledge are going to be fine because then everybody will need to extract
    the insights from the data, and so on so forth. Just like everybody can read nowadays,
    the same process will happen with SQL. And humanity will move to the next level.

    for someone to demonstrate in their job application when breaking into a Web3

    would sign up to follow you, and so on. Another multiplier is developers: protocols
    that focus on onboarding developers and a great developer experience will see
    some of those builders create apps that take off and bring on large groups of
    users. Projects that aim to become quotidian financial alternatives in less stable

    community (or even an audience) who find these insights interesting and useful,
    engage in conversations about them, bring requests, and offer feedback. Being
    actively embedded in communities and understanding data questions and needs is
    what sets apart an impactful Web3 analyst. This involves a mix of curiosity, being
