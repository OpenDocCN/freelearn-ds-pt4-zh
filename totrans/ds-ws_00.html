			<h2 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Conventions</h2>
			<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, path names, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows:</p>
			<p>"<strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong> has a class called <strong class="source-inline">train_test_split</strong>, which provides the functionality for splitting data."</p>
			<p>Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, also appear in the same format.</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">import pandas as pd</p>
			<p class="source-code">from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split</p>
			<p>New terms and important words are shown like this: </p>
			<p>"A dictionary contains multiple elements, like a <strong class="bold">list</strong>, but each element is organized as a key-value pair."</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Code Presentation</h2>
			<p>Lines of code that span multiple lines are split using a backslash ( <strong class="source-inline">\</strong> ). When the code is executed, Python will ignore the backslash, and treat the code on the next line as a direct continuation of the current line.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=5, verbose=1, \</p>
			<p class="source-code">                    validation_split=0.2, shuffle=False)</p>
			<p>Comments are added into code to help explain specific bits of logic. Single-line comments are denoted using the <strong class="source-inline">#</strong> symbol, as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code"># Print the sizes of the datasets</p>
			<p class="source-code">print("Number of Examples in the Dataset = ", X.shape[0])</p>
			<p class="source-code">print("Number of Features for each example = ", X.shape[1])</p>
			<p>Multi-line comments are enclosed by triple quotes, as shown below:</p>
			<p class="source-code">"""</p>
			<p class="source-code">Define a seed for the random number generator to ensure the </p>
			<p class="source-code">result will be reproducible</p>
			<p class="source-code">"""</p>
			<p class="source-code">seed = 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">np.random.seed(seed)</p>
			<p class="source-code">random.set_seed(seed)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Setting up Your Environment</h2>
			<p>Before we explore the book in detail, we need to set up specific software and tools. In the following section, we shall see how to do that.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>How to Set Up Google Colab</h3>
			<p>There are many <strong class="bold">integrated development environments</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) for Python. The most popular one for running data science projects is Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda but this is not the one we are recommending for this book. As you are starting your journey into data science, rather than asking you to setup a Python environment from scratch, we think it is better for you to use a plug-and-play solution so that you can fully focus on learning the concepts we are presenting in this book. We want to remove as many difficulties as we can and ensure your first step into data science is as straightforward as possible.</p>
			<p>Luckily such a tool does exist, and it is called <strong class="bold">Google Colab</strong>. It is a free tool provided by Google that is run on the cloud, so you don't need to buy a new laptop or computer or upgrade its specs. The other benefit of using Colab is most of the Python packages we are using in this book are already installed so you can use them straight away. The only thing you need is a Google account. If you don't have one, you can create one here: <a href="https://packt.live/37mea5X">https://packt.live/37mea5X</a>.</p>
			<p>Then, you will need to subscribe to the Colab service:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, log into Google Drive: <a href="https://packt.live/2TM1v8w%20">https://packt.live/2TM1v8w</a></li>
				<li>Then, go to the following url: <a href="https://packt.live/2NKaAuP%20">https://packt.live/2NKaAuP</a><p>You should see the following screen:</p><div id="_idContainer006" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15019_00_01.jpg" alt="Figure 0.1: Google Colab Introduction page&#13;&#10;" width="626" height="344"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.1: Google Colab Introduction page</p></li>
				<li>Then, you can click on <strong class="source-inline">NEW PYTHON 3 NOTEBOOK</strong> and you should see a new Colab notebook<div id="_idContainer007" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15019_00_02.jpg" alt="Figure 0.2: New Colab notebook&#13;&#10;" width="711" height="233"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.2: New Colab notebook</p>
			<p>You just added Google Colab to your Google account and now you are ready to write and execute your own Python code.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>How to Use Google Colab</h3>
			<p>Now that you have added Google Colab to your account, let's see how to use it. Google Colab is very similar to Jupyter Notebook. It is actually based on Jupyter, but run on Google servers with additional integrations with their services such as Google Drive.</p>
			<p>To open a new Colab notebook, you need to login into your Google Drive account and then click on <strong class="source-inline">+ New</strong> icon:</p>

			<p>A Colab notebook is an interactive IDE where you can run Python code or add text using cells. A cell is a container where you will add your lines of code or any text information related to your project. In each cell, you can put as many lines of code or text as you want. A cell can display the output of your code after running it, so it is a very powerful way of testing and checking the results of your work. It is a good practice to not overload each cell with tons of code. Try to split it into multiple cells so you will be able to run them independently and check step by step if your code is working.</p>
			<p>Let us now see how we can write some Python code in a cell and run it. A cell is composed of 4 main parts: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The text box where you will write your code</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">Run</strong> button for running your code</li>
				<li>The options menu that will provide additional functionalities</li>
				<li>The output display<div id="_idContainer011" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/B15019_00_06.jpg" alt="Figure 0.6: Parts of the Colab notebook cell&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="236"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.6: Parts of the Colab notebook cell</p>
			<p>In this preceding example, we just wrote a simple line of code that adds 2 to 3. Now, we either need to click on the <strong class="source-inline">Run</strong> button or use the shortcut <strong class="bold">Ctrl + Enter</strong> to run the code. The result will then be displayed below the cell. If your code breaks (when there is an error), the error message will be displayed below the cell:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_00_07.jpg" alt="Figure 0.7: Error message on Google Colab&#13;&#10;" width="737" height="218"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.7: Error message on Google Colab</p>
			<p>As you can see, we tried to add an integer to a string which is not possible as their data types are not compatible and this is exactly what this error message is telling us.</p>
			<p>To add a new cell, you just need to click on either <strong class="source-inline">+ Code</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">+ Text</strong> on the option bar at the top:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer013" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_00_08.jpg" alt="Figure 0.8: New cell button&#13;&#10;" width="661" height="107"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.8: New cell button</p>
			<p>If you add a new <strong class="source-inline">Text</strong> cell, you have access to specific options for editing your text such as bold, italic, and hypertext links and so on:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer014" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_00_09.jpg" alt="Figure 0.9: Different options on cell&#13;&#10;" width="807" height="88"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.9: Different options on cell</p>
			<p>This type of cell is actually Markdown compatible. So, you can easily create a title, sub-title, bullet points and so on. Here is a link for learning more about the Markdown options: <a href="https://packt.live/2NVgVDT">https://packt.live/2NVgVDT</a>.</p>
			<p>With the cell option menu, you can delete a cell or move it up or down in the notebook:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_00_10.jpg" alt="Figure 0.10: Cell options&#13;&#10;" width="639" height="35"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.10: Cell options</p>
			<p>If you need to install a specific Python package that is not available in Google Colab, you just need to run a cell with the following syntax:</p>
			<p class="source-code">!pip install &lt;package_name&gt;</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The '!' is a magic command to run shell commands.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer016" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_00_11.jpg" alt="Figure 0.11: Using &quot;!&quot; command&#13;&#10;" width="833" height="171"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.11: Using "!" command</p>
			<p>You just learnt the main functionalities provided by Google Colab for running Python code. There are many more functionalities available, but you now know enough for going through the contents of this book.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Accessing the Code Files</h2>
