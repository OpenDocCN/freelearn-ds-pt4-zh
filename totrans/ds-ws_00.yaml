- en: Where there's data, there's insight. With so much data being generated, there
    is immense scope to extract meaningful information that'll boost business productivity
    and profitability. By learning to convert raw data into game-changing insights,
    you'll open new career paths and opportunities.

    types of projects and showing you how to incorporate machine learning algorithms
    in them. You''ll learn to select a relevant metric and even assess the performance
    of your model. To tune the hyperparameters of an algorithm and improve its accuracy,
    you''ll get hands-on with approaches such as grid search and random search.'

    variables at once, before exploring how to use model ensembling techniques and
    create new features to enhance model performance.

- en: This is one of the most useful data science books for aspiring data analysts,
    data scientists, database engineers, and business analysts. It is aimed at those
    who want to kick-start their careers in data science by quickly learning data
    science techniques without going through all the mathematics behind machine learning
    algorithms. Basic knowledge of the Python programming language will help you easily
    grasp the concepts explained in this book.

    The most popular one for running data science projects is Jupyter Notebook from
    Anaconda but this is not the one we are recommending for this book. As you are
    starting your journey into data science, rather than asking you to setup a Python
    environment from scratch, we think it is better for you to use a plug-and-play
    solution so that you can fully focus on learning the concepts we are presenting
    in this book. We want to remove as many difficulties as we can and ensure your
    first step into data science is as straightforward as possible.

    is most of the Python packages we are using in this book are already installed

- en: A Colab notebook is an interactive IDE where you can run Python code or add
    text using cells. A cell is a container where you will add your lines of code
    or any text information related to your project. In each cell, you can put as
    many lines of code or text as you want. A cell can display the output of your
    code after running it, so it is a very powerful way of testing and checking the
    results of your work. It is a good practice to not overload each cell with tons
    of code. Try to split it into multiple cells so you will be able to run them independently
    and check step by step if your code is working.
