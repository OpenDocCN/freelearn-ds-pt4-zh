			<h1 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the fascinating world of data science! We are sure you must be pretty excited to start your journey and learn interesting and exciting techniques and algorithms. This is exactly what this book is intended for. </p>
			<p>But before diving into it, let's define what data science is: it is a combination of multiple disciplines, including business, statistics, and programming, that intends to extract meaningful insights from data by running controlled experiments similar to scientific research.</p>
			<p>The objective of any data science project is to derive valuable knowledge for the business from data in order to make better decisions. It is the responsibility of data scientists to define the goals to be achieved for a project. This requires business knowledge and expertise. In this book, you will be exposed to some examples of data science tasks from real-world datasets.</p>
			<p>Statistics is a mathematical field used for analyzing and finding patterns from data. A lot of the newest and most advanced techniques still rely on core statistical approaches. This book will present to you the basic techniques required to understand the concepts we will be covering.</p>
			<p>With an exponential increase in data generation, more computational power is required for processing it efficiently. This is the reason why programming is a required skill for data scientists. You may wonder why we chose Python for this Workshop. That's because Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science. It is extremely easy to learn how to code in Python thanks to its simple and easily readable syntax. It also has an incredible number of packages available to anyone for free, such as pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Its community is expanding at an incredible rate, adding more and more new functionalities and improving its performance and reliability. It's no wonder companies such as Facebook, Airbnb, and Google are using it as one of their main stacks. No prior knowledge of Python is required for this book. If you do have some experience with Python or other programming languages, then this will be an advantage, but all concepts will be fully explained, so don't worry if you are new to programming.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Application of Data Science</h1>
			<p>As mentioned in the introduction, data science is a multidisciplinary approach to analyzing and identifying complex patterns and extracting valuable insights from data. Running a data science project usually involves multiple steps, including the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Defining the business problem to be solved</li>
				<li>Collecting or extracting existing data</li>
				<li>Analyzing, visualizing, and preparing data</li>
				<li>Training a model to spot patterns in data and make predictions</li>
				<li>Assessing a model's performance and making improvements</li>
				<li>Communicating and presenting findings and gained insights</li>
				<li>Deploying and maintaining a model</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As its name implies, data science projects require data, but it is actually more important to have defined a clear business problem to solve first. If it's not framed correctly, a project may lead to incorrect results as you may have used the wrong information, not prepared the data properly, or led a model to learn the wrong patterns. So, it is absolutely critical to properly define the scope and objective of a data science project with your stakeholders.</p>
			<p>There are a lot of data science applications in real-world situations or in business environments. For example, healthcare providers may train a model for predicting a medical outcome or its severity based on medical measurements, or a high school may want to predict which students are at risk of dropping out within a year's time based on their historical grades and past behaviors. Corporations may be interested to know the likelihood of a customer buying a certain product based on his or her past purchases. They may also need to better understand which customers are more likely to stop using existing services and churn. These are examples where data science can be used to achieve a clearly defined goal, such as increasing the number of patients detected with a heart condition at an early stage or reducing the number of customers canceling their subscriptions after six months. That sounds exciting, right? Soon enough, you will be working on such interesting projects.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>What Is Machine Learning?</h2>
			<p>When we mention data science, we usually think about machine learning, and some people may not understand the difference between them. Machine learning is the field of building algorithms that can learn patterns by themselves without being programmed explicitly. So machine learning is a family of techniques that can be used at the modeling stage of a data science project.</p>
			<p>Machine learning is composed of three different types of learning:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Supervised learning</li>
				<li>Unsupervised learning</li>
				<li>Reinforcement learning</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Supervised Learning</h3>
			<p>Supervised learning refers to a type of task where an algorithm is trained to learn patterns based on prior knowledge. That means this kind of learning requires the labeling of the outcome (also called the response variable, dependent variable, or target variable) to be predicted beforehand. For instance, if you want to train a model that will predict whether a customer will cancel their subscription, you will need a dataset with a column (or variable) that already contains the churn outcome (cancel or not cancel) for past or existing customers. This outcome has to be labeled by someone prior to the training of a model. If this dataset contains 5,000 observations, then all of them need to have the outcome being populated. The objective of the model is to learn the relationship between this outcome column and the other features (also called independent variables or predictor variables). Following is an example of such a dataset:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_01.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1: Example of customer churn dataset&#13;&#10;" width="1344" height="918"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.1: Example of customer churn dataset</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">Cancel</strong> column is the response variable. This is the column you are interested in, and you want the model to predict accurately the outcome for new input data (in this case, new customers). All the other columns are the predictor variables.</p>
			<p>The model, after being trained, may find the following pattern: a customer is more likely to cancel their subscription after 12 months and if their average monthly spent is over <strong class="source-inline">$50</strong>. So, if a new customer has gone through 15 months of subscription and is spending $85 per month, the model will predict this customer will cancel their contract in the future. </p>
			<p>When the response variable contains a limited number of possible values (or classes), it is a classification problem (you will learn more about this in <em class="italic">Chapter 3, Binary Classification</em>, and <em class="italic">Chapter 4, Multiclass Classification with RandomForest</em>). The model will learn how to predict the right class given the values of the independent variables. The churn example we just mentioned is a classification problem as the response variable can only take two different values: <strong class="source-inline">yes</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">no</strong>.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, if the response variable can have a value from an infinite number of possibilities, it is called a regression problem.</p>
			<p>An example of a regression problem is where you are trying to predict the exact number of mobile phones produced every day for some manufacturing plants. This value can potentially range from 0 to an infinite number (or a number big enough to have a large range of potential values), as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.2</em>. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_02.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2: Example of a mobile phone production dataset&#13;&#10;" width="1181" height="261"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2: Example of a mobile phone production dataset</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, you can see that the values for <strong class="source-inline">Daily output</strong> can take any value from <strong class="source-inline">15000</strong> to more than <strong class="source-inline">50000</strong>. This is a regression problem, which we will look at in <em class="italic">Chapter 2, Regression</em>.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
			<p>Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that doesn't require any response variables at all. In this case, the model will learn patterns from the data by itself. You may ask what kind of pattern it can find if there is no target specified beforehand. </p>
			<p>This type of algorithm usually can detect similarities between variables or records, so it will try to group those that are very close to each other. This kind of algorithm can be used for clustering (grouping records) or dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of variables). Clustering is very popular for performing customer segmentation, where the algorithm will look to group customers with similar behaviors together from the data. <em class="italic">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Performing Your First Cluster Analysis</em>, will walk you through an example of clustering analysis.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
			<p>Reinforcement learning is another type of algorithm that learns how to act in a specific environment based on the feedback it receives. You may have seen some videos where algorithms are trained to play Atari games by themselves. Reinforcement learning techniques are being used to teach the agent how to act in the game based on the rewards or penalties it receives from the game.</p>
			<p>For instance, in the game Pong, the agent will learn to not let the ball drop after multiple rounds of training in which it receives high penalties every time the ball drops.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Reinforcement learning algorithms are out of scope and will not be covered in this book.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Overview of Python</h1>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science. But before diving into Python's data science applications, let's have a quick introduction to some core Python concepts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Types of Variable</h2>
			<p>In Python, you can handle and manipulate different types of variables. Each has its own specificities and benefits. We will not go through every single one of them but rather focus on the main ones that you will have to use in this book. For each of the following code examples, you can run the code in Google Colab to view the given output.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Numeric Variables</h3>
			<p>The most basic variable type is numeric. This can contain integer or decimal (or float) numbers, and some mathematical operations can be performed on top of them. </p>
			<p>Let's use an integer variable called <strong class="source-inline">var1</strong> that will take the value <strong class="source-inline">8</strong> and another one called <strong class="source-inline">var2</strong> with the value <strong class="source-inline">160.88</strong>, and add them together with the <strong class="source-inline">+</strong> operator, as shown here:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var1 = 8</p>
			<p class="source-code">var2 = 160.88</p>
			<p class="source-code">var1 + var2</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_03.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3: Output of the addition of two variables&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="87"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3: Output of the addition of two variables</p>
			<p>In Python, you can perform other mathematical operations on numerical variables, such as multiplication (with the <strong class="source-inline">*</strong> operator) and division (with <strong class="source-inline">/</strong>).</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Text Variables</h3>
			<p>Another interesting type of variable is <strong class="source-inline">string</strong>, which contains textual information. You can create a variable with some specific text using the single or double quote, as shown in the following example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var3 = 'Hello, '</p>
			<p class="source-code">var4 = 'World'</p>
			<p>In order to display the content of a variable, you can call the <strong class="source-inline">print()</strong> function:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var3)</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var4)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer024" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_04.jpg" alt="Figure 1.4: Printing the two text variables&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="132"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.4: Printing the two text variables</p>
			<p>Python also provides an interface called f-strings for printing text with the value of defined variables. It is very handy when you want to print results with additional text to make it more readable and interpret results. It is also quite common to use f-strings to print logs. You will need to add <strong class="source-inline">f</strong> before the quotes (or double quotes) to specify that the text will be an f-string. Then you can add an existing variable inside the quotes and display the text with the value of this variable. You need to wrap the variable with curly brackets, <strong class="source-inline">{}</strong>. </p>
			<p>For instance, if we want to print <strong class="source-inline">Text:</strong> before the values of <strong class="source-inline">var3</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">var4</strong>, we will write the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(f"Text: {var3} {var4}!")</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_05.jpg" alt="Figure 1.5: Printing with f-strings&#13;&#10;" width="913" height="46"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.5: Printing with f-strings</p>
			<p>You can also perform some text-related transformations with string variables, such as capitalizing or replacing characters. For instance, you can concatenate the two variables together with the <strong class="source-inline">+</strong> operator:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var3 + var4</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_06.jpg" alt="Figure 1.6: Concatenation of the two text variables&#13;&#10;" width="811" height="49"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.6: Concatenation of the two text variables</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Python List</h3>
			<p>Another very useful type of variable is the list. It is a collection of items that can be changed (you can add, update, or remove items). To declare a list, you will need to use square brackets, <strong class="source-inline">[]</strong>, like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var5 = ['I', 'love', 'data', 'science']</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var5)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_07.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7: List containing only string items&#13;&#10;" width="1015" height="54"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.7: List containing only string items</p>
			<p>A list can have different item types, so you can mix numerical and text variables in it:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var6 = ['Packt', 15019, 2020, 'Data Science']</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var6)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_08.jpg" alt="Figure 1.8: List containing numeric and string items&#13;&#10;" width="845" height="52"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.8: List containing numeric and string items</p>
			<p>An item in a list can be accessed by its index (its position in the list). To access the first (index 0) and third elements (index 2) of a list, you do the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var6[0])</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var6[2])</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In Python, all indexes start at <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. </p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_09.jpg" alt="Figure 1.9: The first and third items in the var6 list&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="153"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.9: The first and third items in the var6 list</p>
			<p>Python provides an API to access a range of items using the <strong class="source-inline">:</strong> operator. You just need to specify the starting index on the left side of the operator and the ending index on the right side. The ending index is always excluded from the range. So, if you want to get the first three items (index 0 to 2), you should do as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var6[0:3])</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer030" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_10.jpg" alt="Figure 1.10: The first three items of var6&#13;&#10;" width="992" height="50"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.10: The first three items of var6</p>
			<p>You can also iterate through every item of a list using a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. If you want to print every item of the <strong class="source-inline">var6</strong> list, you should do this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for item in var6:</p>
			<p class="source-code">    print(item)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_11.jpg" alt="Figure 1.11: Output of the for loop&#13;&#10;" width="966" height="146"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.11: Output of the for loop</p>
			<p>You can add an item at the end of the list using the <strong class="source-inline">.append()</strong> method:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var6.append('Python')</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var6)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_12.jpg" alt="Figure 1.12: Output of var6 after inserting the 'Python' item&#13;&#10;" width="995" height="68"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.12: Output of var6 after inserting the 'Python' item</p>
			<p>To delete an item from the list, you use the <strong class="source-inline">.remove()</strong> method:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var6.remove(15019)</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var6)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.13: Output of var6 after removing the '15019' item </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Python Dictionary</h3>
			<p>Another very popular Python variable used by data scientists is the dictionary type. For example, it can be used to load JSON data into Python so that it can then be converted into a DataFrame (you will learn more about the JSON format and DataFrames in the following sections). A dictionary contains multiple elements, like a <strong class="bold">list</strong>, but each element is organized as a key-value pair. A dictionary is not indexed by numbers but by keys. So, to access a specific value, you will have to call the item by its corresponding key. To define a dictionary in Python, you will use curly brackets, <strong class="source-inline">{}</strong>, and specify the keys and values separated by <strong class="source-inline">:</strong>, as shown here:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var7 = {'Topic': 'Data Science', 'Language': 'Python'}</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(var7)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer034" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_14.jpg" alt="Figure 1.14: Output of var7&#13;&#10;" width="1155" height="58"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.14: Output of var7</p>
			<p>To access a specific value, you need to provide the corresponding key name. For instance, if you want to get the value <strong class="source-inline">Python</strong>, you do this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var7['Language']</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer035" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_15.jpg" alt="Figure 1.15: Value for the 'Language' key&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="88"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.15: Value for the 'Language' key</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Each key-value pair in a dictionary needs to be unique.</p>
			<p>Python provides a method to access all the key names from a dictionary, <strong class="source-inline">.keys()</strong>, which is used as shown in the following code snippet:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var7.keys()</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer036" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.16: List of key names</p>
			<p>There is also a method called <strong class="source-inline">.values()</strong>, which is used to access all the values of a dictionary:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var7.values()</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer037" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.17: List of values</p>
			<p>You can iterate through all items from a dictionary using a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop and the <strong class="source-inline">.items()</strong> method, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for key, value in var7.items():</p>
			<p class="source-code">    print(key)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    print(value)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.18: Output after iterating through the items of a dictionary</p>

			<p>In the next section, you will learn more about the two main Python packages used for data science: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Python for Data Science</h1>
			<p>Python offers an incredible number of packages for data science. A package is a collection of prebuilt functions and classes shared publicly by its author(s). These packages extend the core functionalities of Python. The Python Package Index (<a href="https://packt.live/37iTRXc">https://packt.live/37iTRXc</a>) lists all the packages available in Python.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will present to you two of the most popular ones: <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>The pandas Package</h2>
			<p>The pandas package provides an incredible amount of APIs for manipulating data structures. The two main data structures defined in the <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> package are <strong class="source-inline">DataFrame</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Series</strong>.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>DataFrame and Series</h3>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">DataFrame</strong> is a tabular data structure that is represented as a two-dimensional table. It is composed of rows, columns, indexes, and cells. It is very similar to a sheet in Excel or a table in a database:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer048" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_28.jpg" alt="Figure 1.28: Components of a DataFrame&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="825"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.28: Components of a DataFrame</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 1.28</em>, there are three different columns: <strong class="source-inline">algorithm</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">learning</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">type</strong>. Each of these columns (also called variables) contains a specific type of information. For instance, the <strong class="source-inline">algorithm</strong> variable lists the names of different machine learning algorithms. </p>
			<p>A row stores the information related to a record (also called an observation). For instance, row number <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> (index number <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>) refers to the <strong class="source-inline">RandomForest</strong> record and all its attributes are stored in the different columns. </p>
			<p>Finally, a cell is the value of a given row and column. For example, <strong class="source-inline">Clustering</strong> is the value of the cell of the row index <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> and the <strong class="source-inline">type</strong> column. You can see it as the intersection of a specified row and column.</p>
			<p>So, a DataFrame is a structured representation of some data organized by rows and columns. A row represents an observation and each column contains the value of its attributes. This is the most common data structure used in data science.</p>
			<p>In pandas, a DataFrame is represented by the <strong class="source-inline">DataFrame</strong> class. A <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> DataFrame is composed of <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> Series, which are 1-dimensional arrays. A <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> Series is basically a single column in a DataFrame.</p>
			<p>Data is usually classified into two groups: <em class="italic">structured</em> and <em class="italic">unstructured</em>. Think of structured data as database tables or Excel spreadsheets where each column and row has a predefined structure. For example, in a table or spreadsheet that lists all the employees of a company, every record will follow the same pattern, such as the first column containing the date of birth, the second and third ones being for first and last names, and so on. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, unstructured data is not organized with predefined and static patterns. Text and images are good examples of unstructured data. If you read a book and look at each sentence, it will not be possible for you to say that the second word of a sentence is always a verb or a person's name; it can be anything depending on how the author wanted to convey the information they wanted to share. Each sentence has its own structure and will be different from the last. Similarly, for a group of images, you can't say that pixels 20 to 30 will always represent the eye of a person or the wheel of a car: it will be different for each image.</p>
			<p>Data can come from different data sources: there could be flat files, data storage, or Application Programming Interface (API) feeds, for example. In this book, we will work with flat files such as CSVs, Excel spreadsheets, or JSON. All these types of files are storing information with their own format and structure.</p>
			<p>We'll have a look at the CSV file first.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>CSV Files</h3>
			<p>CSV files use the comma character—<strong class="source-inline">,</strong>—to separate columns and newlines for a new row. The previous example of a DataFrame would look like this in a CSV file:</p>
			<p class="source-code">algorithm,learning,type</p>
			<p class="source-code">Linear Regression,Supervised,Regression</p>
			<p class="source-code">Logistic Regression,Supervised,Classification</p>
			<p class="source-code">RandomForest,Supervised,Regression or Classification</p>
			<p class="source-code">k-means,Unsupervised,Clustering</p>
			<p>In Python, you need to first import the packages you require before being able to use them. To do so, you will have to use the <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> command. You can create an alias of each imported package using the <strong class="source-inline">as</strong> keyword. It is quite common to import the <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> package with the alias <strong class="source-inline">pd</strong>: </p>
			<p class="source-code">import pandas as pd</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> provides a <strong class="source-inline">.read_csv()</strong> method to easily load a CSV file directly into a DataFrame. You just need to provide the path or the URL to the CSV file, as shown below.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Watch out for the slashes in the string below. Remember that the backslashes ( <strong class="source-inline">\</strong> ) are used to split the code across multiple lines, while the forward slashes ( <strong class="source-inline">/</strong> ) are part of the URL.</p>
			<p class="source-code">pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktWorkshops'\</p>
			<p class="source-code">            '/The-Data-Science-Workshop/master/Chapter01/'\</p>
			<p class="source-code">            'Dataset/csv_example.csv')</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.29: DataFrame after loading a CSV file</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In this book, we will be loading datasets stored in the Packt GitHub repository: <a href="https://packt.live/2ucwsId">https://packt.live/2ucwsId</a>. </p>
			<p>GitHub wraps stored data into its own specific format. To load the original version of a dataset, you will need to load the raw version of it by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Raw</strong> button and copying the URL provided on your browser.</p>
			<p>Have a look at <em class="italic">Figure 1.30</em>:</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Excel Spreadsheets</h3>
			<p>Excel is a Microsoft tool and is very popular in the industry. It has its own internal structure for recording additional information, such as the data type of each cell or even Excel formulas. There is a specific method in <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> to load Excel spreadsheets called <strong class="source-inline">.read_excel()</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">pd.read_excel('https://github.com/PacktWorkshops'\</p>
			<p class="source-code">              '/The-Data-Science-Workshop/blob/master'\</p>
			<p class="source-code">              '/Chapter01/Dataset/excel_example.xlsx?raw=true')</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.31: Dataframe after loading an Excel spreadsheet</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>JSON</h3>
			<p>JSON is a very popular file format, mainly used for transferring data from web APIs. Its structure is very similar to that of a Python dictionary with key-value pairs. The example DataFrame we used before would look like this in JSON format:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{</p>
			<p class="source-code">  "algorithm":{</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "0":"Linear Regression",</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "1":"Logistic Regression",</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "2":"RandomForest",</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "3":"k-means"</p>
			<p class="source-code">  },</p>
			<p class="source-code">  "learning":{</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "0":"Supervised",</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "1":"Supervised",</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "2":"Supervised",</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "3":"Unsupervised"</p>
			<p class="source-code">  },</p>
			<p class="source-code">  "type":{</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "0":"Regression",</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "1":"Classification",</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "2":"Regression or Classification",</p>
			<p class="source-code">     "3":"Clustering"</p>
			<p class="source-code">  }</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>As you may have guessed, there is a <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> method for reading JSON data as well, and it is called <strong class="source-inline">.read_json()</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">pd.read_json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktWorkshops'\</p>
			<p class="source-code">             '/The-Data-Science-Workshop/master/Chapter01'\</p>
			<p class="source-code">             '/Dataset/json_example.json')</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>

			<p>pandas is not limited to only loading data into DataFrames; it also provides a lot of other APIs for creating, analyzing, or transforming DataFrames. You will be introduced to some of its most useful methods in the following chapters.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Exercise 1.02: Loading Data of Different Formats into a pandas DataFrame</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will practice loading different data formats, such as CSV, TSV, and XLSX, into pandas DataFrames. The dataset we will use is the Top 10 Postcodes for the First Home Owner Grants dataset (this is a grant provided by the Australian government to help first-time real estate buyers). It lists the 10 postcodes (also known as zip codes) with the highest number of First Home Owner grants.</p>
			<p>In this dataset, you will find the number of First Home Owner grant applications for each postcode and the corresponding suburb.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">This dataset can be found on our GitHub repository at <a href="https://packt.live/2FgAT7d">https://packt.live/2FgAT7d</a>.</p>

			<p>In this exercise, we learned how to load the Top 10 Postcodes for First Home Buyer Grants dataset from different file formats.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will be introduced to scikit-learn.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Scikit-Learn</h1>
			<p>Scikit-learn (also referred to as <strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong>) is another extremely popular package used by data scientists. The main purpose of <strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong> is to provide APIs for processing data and training machine learning algorithms. But before moving ahead, we need to know what a model is.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>What Is a Model?</h3>
			<p>A machine learning model learns patterns from data and creates a mathematical function to generate predictions. A supervised learning algorithm will try to find the relationship between a response variable and the given features.</p>
			<p>Have a look at the following example.</p>
			<p>A mathematical function can be represented as a function, ƒ(), that is applied to some input variables, X (which is composed of multiple features), and will calculate an output (or prediction), ŷ: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_37.jpg" alt="Figure 1.37: Function f(X)&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="78"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.37: Function f(X)</p>
			<p>The function, ƒ(), can be quite complex and have different numbers of parameters. If we take a linear regression (this will be presented in more detail in <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Regression</em>) as an example, the model parameters can be represented as W=( w<span class="subscript">1</span>, w<span class="subscript">2</span>, ... , w<span class="subscript">n</span>). So, the function we saw earlier will become as follows: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_38.jpg" alt="Figure 1.38: Function for linear regression&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="95"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.38: Function for linear regression</p>
			<p>A machine learning algorithm will receive some examples of input <em class="italic">X</em> with the relevant output, <em class="italic">y</em>, and its goal will be to find the values of ( w<span class="subscript">1</span>, w<span class="subscript">2</span>, ... , w<span class="subscript">n</span>) that will minimize the difference between its prediction, <em class="italic">ŷ</em> and the true output, <em class="italic">y</em>.</p>
			<p>The previous formulas can be a bit intimidating, but this is actually quite simple. Let's say we have a dataset composed of only one target variable y and one feature X, such as the following one:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_39.jpg" alt="Figure 1.39: Example of a dataset with one target variable and one feature&#13;&#10;" width="893" height="690"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.39: Example of a dataset with one target variable and one feature</p>
			<p>If we fit a linear regression on this dataset, the algorithm will try to find a solution for the following equation:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_40.jpg" alt="Figure 1.40: Function f(x) for linear regression fitting on a dataset&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="65"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.40: Function f(x) for linear regression fitting on a dataset</p>
			<p>o, it just needs to find the values of the <strong class="source-inline">w0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">w</strong><span class="subscript">1</span> parameters that will approximate the data as closely as possible. In this case, the algorithm may come up with <strong class="source-inline">wo = 0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">w1 = 10</strong>. So, the function the model learns will be as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_41.jpg" alt="Figure 1.41: Function f(x) using estimated values&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="65"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.41: Function f(x) using estimated values</p>
			<p>We can visualize this on the same graph as for the data:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer062" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_42.jpg" alt="Figure 1.42: Fitted linear model on the example dataset &#13;&#10;" width="1346" height="1033"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.42: Fitted linear model on the example dataset </p>
			<p>We can see that the fitted model (the orange line) is approximating the original data quite closely. So, if we predict the outcome for a new data point, it will be very close to the true value. For example, if we take a point that is close to 5 (let's say its values are <strong class="source-inline">x = 5.1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">y = 48</strong>), the model will predict the following:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer063" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_43.jpg" alt="Figure 1.43: Model prediction&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="65"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.43: Model prediction</p>
			<p>This value is actually very close to the ground truth, 48 (red circle). So, our model prediction is quite accurate.</p>
			<p>This is it. It is quite simple, right? In general, a dataset will have more than one feature, but the logic will be the same: the trained model will try to find the best parameters for each variable to get predictions as close as possible to the true values.</p>
			<p>We just saw an example of linear models, but there are actually other types of machine learning algorithms, such as tree-based or neural networks, that can find more complex patterns from data.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Model Hyperparameters</h3>
			<p>On top of the model parameters that are learned automatically by the algorithm (now you understand why we call it machine learning), there is also another type of parameter called the hyperparameter. Hyperparameters cannot be learned by the model. They are set by data scientists in order to define some specific conditions for the algorithm learning process. These hyperparameters are different for each family of algorithms and they can, for instance, help fast-track the learning process or limit the risk of overfitting. In this book, you will learn how to tune some of these machine learning hyperparameters.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>The sklearn API</h3>
			<p>As mentioned before, the scikit-learn (or <strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong>) package has implemented an incredible amount of machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, k-means, and random forest. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Do not worry about these terms—you are not expected to know what these algorithms involve just yet. You will see a simple random forest example in this chapter, but all of these algorithms will be explained in detail in later chapters of the book.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong> groups algorithms by family. For instance, <strong class="source-inline">RandomForest</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">GradientBoosting</strong> are part of the <strong class="source-inline">ensemble</strong> module. In order to make use of an algorithm, you will need to import it first like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier</p>
			<p>Another reason why <strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong> is so popular is that all the algorithms follow the exact same API structure. So, once you have learned how to train one algorithm, it is extremely easy to train another one with very minimal code changes. With <strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong>, there are four main steps to train a machine learning model:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Instantiate a model with specified hyperparameters: this will configure the machine learning model you want to train.</li>
				<li>Train the model with training data: during this step, the model will learn the best parameters to get predictions as close as possible to the actual values of the target.</li>
				<li>Predict the outcome from input data: using the learned parameter, the model will predict the outcome for new data.</li>
				<li>Assess the performance of the model predictions: for checking whether the model learned the right patterns to get accurate predictions.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">In a real project, there might be more steps depending on the situation, but for simplicity, we will stick with these four for now. You will learn the remaining ones in the following chapters.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As mentioned before, each algorithm will have its own specific hyperparameters that can be tuned. To instantiate a model, you just need to create a new variable from the class you imported previously and specify the values of the hyperparameters. If you leave the hyperparameters blank, the model will use the default values specified by <strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong>. </p>
			<p>It is recommended to at least set the <strong class="source-inline">random_state</strong> hyperparameter in order to get reproducible results every time that you have to run the same code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1)</p>
			<p>The second step is to train the model with some data. In this example, we will use a simple dataset that classifies 178 instances of Italian wines into 3 categories based on 13 features. This dataset is part of the few examples that <strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong> provides within its API. We need to load the data first:</p>
			<p class="source-code">from sklearn.datasets import load_wine</p>
			<p class="source-code">features, target = load_wine(return_X_y=True)</p>
			<p>Then using the <strong class="source-inline">.fit()</strong> method to train the model, you will provide the features and the target variable as input:</p>
			<p class="source-code">rf_model.fit(features, target)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer064" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_44.jpg" alt="Figure 1.44: Logs of the trained Random Forest model&#13;&#10;" width="1366" height="249"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.44: Logs of the trained Random Forest model</p>
			<p>In the preceding output, we can see a Random Forest model with the default hyperparameters. You will be introduced to some of them in <em class="italic">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Multiclass Classification with RandomForest</em>.</p>
			<p>Once trained, we can use the <strong class="source-inline">.predict()</strong> method to predict the target for one or more observations. Here we will use the same data as for the training step:</p>
			<p class="source-code">preds = rf_model.predict(features)</p>
			<p class="source-code">preds</p>
			<p>You should get the following output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer065" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_45.jpg" alt="Figure 1.45: Predictions of the trained Random Forest model&#13;&#10;" width="1665" height="472"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.45: Predictions of the trained Random Forest model</p>
			<p>From the preceding output, you can see that the 178 different wines in the dataset have been classified into one of the three different wine categories. The first lot of wines have been classified as being in category 0, the second lot are category 1, and the last lot are category 2. At this point, we do not know what classes 0, 1, or 2 represent (in the context of the "type" of wine in each category), but finding this out would form part of the larger data science project.</p>
			<p>Finally, we want to assess the model's performance by comparing its predictions to the actual values of the target variable. There are a lot of different metrics that can be used for assessing model performance, and you will learn more about them later in this book. For now, though, we will just use a metric called <strong class="bold">accuracy</strong>. This metric calculates the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of observations:</p>
			<p class="source-code">from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score</p>
			<p class="source-code">accuracy_score(target, preds)</p>
			<p>You should get the following output</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer066" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15019_01_46.jpg" alt="Figure 1.46: Accuracy of the trained Random Forest model&#13;&#10;" width="713" height="39"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.46: Accuracy of the trained Random Forest model</p>
			<p>In this example, the Random Forest model learned to predict correctly all the observations from this dataset; it achieves an accuracy score of <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> (that is, 100% of the predictions matched the actual true values). </p>
			<p>It's as simple as that! This may be too good to be true. In the following chapters, you will learn how to check whether the trained models are able to accurately predict unseen or future data points or if they have only learned the specific patterns of this input data (also called overfitting).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Exercise 1.03: Predicting Breast Cancer from a Dataset Using sklearn</h2>
