- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17990_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016), *Data Augmentation Made Easy*,
    is an introduction to data augmentation. Readers will learn the definition of
    data augmentation, data types, and its benefits. Furthermore, the readers will
    learn how to select the appropriate online Jupyter Python Notebook or install
    it locally. Finally, [*Chapter 1*](B17990_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016) concludes
    with a discussion on coding conventions, GitHub access, and the foundation of
    Object-Oriented class code, named Pluto.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B17990_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038), *Biases in Data Augmentation*,
    defines the computation, human, and systemic biases with plenty of real-world
    examples to illustrate the differences between these types of biases. Readers
    will have the opportunity to practice identifying data biases by downloading three
    real-world image datasets and two text datasets from the Kaggle website to reinforce
    their learning. Once downloaded, readers will learn how to display image and text
    batches and discuss potential biases in the data.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17990_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058), *Image Augmentation for Classification*,
    has two parts. First, readers will learn the concepts and techniques of augmentation
    for Image classification, followed by hands-on Python coding and a detailed explanation
    of the image augmentation methods with a safe level of image distortion. By the
    end of this chapter, readers will learn the concepts and hands-on techniques in
    Python coding for classification image augmentation using six real-world image
    datasets. In addition, they will examine several Python open-source libraries
    for image augmentation and write Python wrapper functions using the chosen libraries.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B17990_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082), *Image Augmentation for Segmentation*,
    highlights that both Image Segmentation and Image Classification are critical
    components of the Computer Vision domain. Image Segmentation involves grouping
    parts of an image that belong to the same object, also known as pixel-level classification.
    Unlike Image Classification, which identifies and predicts the subject or label
    of a photo, Image Segmentation determines if a pixel belongs to a list of objects
    or tags. The image augmentation methods for segmentation or classification are
    the same, except segmentation comes with an additional mask or ground-truth image.
    [*Chapter 4*](B17990_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082) aims to provide continuing Geometric
    and Photometric transformations for Image Segmentation.'

- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B17990_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101), *Text Augmentation*, explores
    text augmentation, a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to generate
    additional data by modifying or creating new text from existing text data. Text
    augmentation can involve techniques such as character swapping, noise injection,
    synonym replacement, word deletion, word insertion, and word swapping. Image and
    Text augmentation has the same goal. They strive to increase the training dataset’s
    size and improve AI prediction accuracy. In Chapter 5, you will learn about Text
    augmentation and how to code the methods in the Python Notebooks.'

- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B17990_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116), *Text Augmentation with Machine
    Learning*, discusses an advanced technique that aims to improve ML model accuracy.
    Interestingly, text augmentation uses a pre-trained ML model to create additional
    training NLP data, creating a circular process. Although ML coding is beyond the
    scope of this book, understanding the difference between using libraries and ML
    for text augmentation can be beneficial. [*Chapter 6*](B17990_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116)
    will cover text augmentation with Machine Learning.'

- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B17990_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor135), *Audio Data Augmentation*,
    explains that similar to image and text augmentation, the objective of audio augmentation
    is to extend the dataset for gaining higher accuracy forecast or prediction in
    a Generative AI system. Audio augmentation is cost-effective and a viable option
    when acquiring additional audio files is expensive or time-consuming. Writing
    about audio augmentation methods poses unique challenges. The first is that audio
    is not visual like images or text. If the format is audiobooks, web pages, or
    mobile apps, we play the sound, but the medium is paper. Thus, we will transform
    the audio signal into a visual representation. [*Chapter 6*](B17990_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116)
    will cover Audio augmentation using Waveform transformation. You can play the
    audio file on the Python Notebook.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B17990_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor167), *Audio Data Augmentation with
    Spectogram*, builds on the previous chapter’s topic of audio augmentation by exploring
    additional visualization methods beyond the Waveform graph. An audio spectrogram
    is another visualizing method to see the audio components. The inputs to the spectrogram
    are a one-dimensional array of amplitude values and the sampling rate. They are
    the same inputs as the Waveform graph. An audio spectrogram is sometimes called
    sonographs, sonagrams, voiceprints, or voicegrams. The typical usage is for music,
    human speech, and sonar. A short standard definition is a spectrum of frequency
    maps with time duration. In other words, the Y-axis is the frequency in Hz or
    kHz, and the X-axis is the time duration in seconds or milliseconds. [*Chapter
    8*](B17990_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor167) will cover the audio spectrogram standard
    format, variation of a spectrogram, Mel-spectrogram, Chroma Short-time Fourier
    transformation (STFT), and augmentation techniques.'

- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B17990_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor182), *Tabular Data Augmentation*,
    involves taking data from a database, spreadsheet, or table format and extending
    it for the AI training cycle. The goal is to increase the accuracy of prediction
    or forecast, which is the same for image, text, and audio augmentations. Tabular
    augmentation is a relativelynew field for Data scientists. It is contrary to using
    analytics for reporting, summarizing, or forecasting. In analytics, altering or
    adding data to skew the results to a preconceived desired outcome is unethical.
    In data augmentation, the purpose is to derive new data from an existing dataset.
    The two goals are incongruent, but they are not. There will be a slight departure
    from the image, text, and audio augmentation format. We will spend more time in
    Python code studying the real-world tabular dataset.'

    read a chapter, run the code on the Python Notebook, re-read the chapter’s part
    that confused you, and jump back to hacking the code until the concept or technique
    is firmly understood.
