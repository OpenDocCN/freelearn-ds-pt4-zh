			<p class="calibre3"><st c="1784">René Descartes (1596-1650), the French philosopher and mathematician, is renowned for his theory of mind-body dualism. </st><st c="1904">He proposed that the mind and body are two fundamentally distinct substances: the mind as a non-extended, thinking entity and the body as an extended, non-thinking entity. </st><st c="2076">Descartes believed in the interaction between these substances while maintaining their separateness and independent existence. </st><st c="2203">This dualistic view emphasizes the separation of the mental (mind) and physical (body) aspects, positing that they differ in nature. </st><st c="2336">His theory has had a significant influence on philosophical discussions about consciousness and the relationship between mind </st><span><st c="2462">and body.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="2471">But why are we </st><a id="_idIndexMarker000" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="2487">starting our discussion about algorithms with Descartes’ </st><em class="italic"><st c="2544">theory of dualism</st></em><st c="2561">, despite serious criticisms of it from philosophers? </st><st c="2615">The answer lies in the model’s ability to aid our understanding of the essence of algorithms and their uniqueness among all </st><span><st c="2739">human inventions.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="2756">The historical narrative of computers, primarily seen as devices for automating problem-solving through mathematical representations, starts with a </st><em class="italic"><st c="2905">distinct separation between hardware and software</st></em><st c="2954">. Hardware is the tangible, physical component that executes software code, producing the desired results. </st><st c="3061">Conversely, software is the systematic solution articulated through a formal language known as a computer program, ranging from high-level languages such as Python and C++ to low-level ones such as assembly language and </st><span><st c="3281">machine code.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="3294">However, hardware </st><a id="_idIndexMarker001" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="3313">and software are fundamentally different, a distinction particularly notable in computer systems. </st><st c="3411">The primary difference lies in the disciplines that govern each. </st><st c="3476">Computer hardware is governed by the laws of physics, dictating how the physical components operate and interact. </st><st c="3590">In contrast, computer software operates within the domain of mathematics, which dictates the logic, algorithms, and functions that software can perform. </st><st c="3743">This dichotomy sets computer systems apart from other human-made technologies. </st><st c="3822">For example, a car is governed entirely by physical laws at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. </st><st c="3923">A significant distinction between hardware and software is that hardware is mortal. </st><st c="4007">It is prone to decay, defects, and expiration. </st><st c="4054">In contrast, software is immortal, not subject to depreciation, aging, defects, or expiration. </st><st c="4149">This concept mirrors Descartes’ theory </st><span><st c="4188">of dualism.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="4199">Software, at its core, embodies an abstract concept known as an </st><strong class="bold"><st c="4264">algorithm</st></strong><st c="4273">. An algorithm represents an abstract set of rules or procedures, which can be realized and expressed in many ways across various programming languages. </st><st c="4426">Despite this diversity in representation, all these different implementations of the same algorithm are designed to produce a singular, consistent output. </st><st c="4581">This characteristic of algorithms, being abstract yet versatile in their implementation, is what makes them a fundamental element in software development and design. </st><st c="4747">In the real world, the concepts most akin to algorithms are food recipes and musical notes. </st><st c="4839">Both represent step-by-step implementations of a </st><em class="italic"><st c="4888">plan </st></em><st c="4893">to create food </st><span><st c="4908">or music.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="4917">The indication </st><a id="_idIndexMarker002" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="4933">of a good recipe, aside from yielding delicious food, is in its expression in a quantitative and abstract form, allowing any cook, regardless of experience level, to execute it. </st><st c="5111">However, this is often not entirely feasible, as recipes are typically written in natural language, making them prone to various interpretations. </st><st c="5257">Another desired trait of a good recipe is its independence from specific kitchen equipment, although this too is not always realistic. </st><st c="5392">Recipes, much like algorithms, aim for a level of universality in their application, but the nuances of language and specific contexts can affect their reproducibility </st><span><st c="5560">and outcomes.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="5573">The situation with musical notes is slightly more favorable. </st><st c="5635">Since these notes resemble formal language, they offer a clearer, more standardized method of instruction. </st><st c="5742">However, the actual music produced is still subject to the interpretation of the player, the characteristics of the instruments, and a myriad of acoustic factors. </st><st c="5905">While musical notes provide a more precise guide compared to the natural language of recipes, the variability in performance and environmental conditions means that the outcome can still vary significantly. </st><st c="6112">This underscores the challenge of translating abstract, formalized instructions into consistent real-world results, much like the execution of algorithms in different </st><span><st c="6279">computing environments.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="6302">These two </st><a id="_idIndexMarker003" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="6313">examples help us infer key properties </st><span><st c="6351">of algorithms:</st></span></p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="6365">Programmer independence</st></strong><st c="6389">: Ideally, the final product of an algorithm should be largely independent of who implements it. </st><st c="6487">This means that regardless of the programmer, the algorithm should consistently produce the same correct result, and the computational cost or resource usage should be comparably similar across </st><span><st c="6681">different implementations.</st></span></li>
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="6707">Hardware independence</st></strong><st c="6729">: An effective algorithm should, as much as possible, be independent of the hardware on which it runs. </st><st c="6833">It should be capable of producing consistent results across various hardware platforms without significant modifications or dependence on specific </st><span><st c="6980">hardware features.</st></span></li>
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="6998">Abstraction and clarity</st></strong><st c="7022">: Algorithms should be abstract and unambiguous, leaving no room for interpretation. </st><st c="7108">This clarity ensures that the algorithm can be understood </st><a id="_idIndexMarker004" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="7166">and implemented consistently, regardless of the programmer’s subjective understanding </st><span><st c="7252">or approach.</st></span></li>
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="7264">Quantifiable correctness and cost</st></strong><st c="7298">: The correctness of an algorithm – its ability to produce the intended result – and its cost, in terms of computational resources such as time and memory, must be quantifiable. </st><st c="7477">This allows for the objective assessment and comparison of different algorithms based on their efficiency </st><span><st c="7583">and effectiveness.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="7601">Algorithms are </st><a id="_idIndexMarker005" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="7617">defined as step-by-step, procedural, and often iterative methods for solving problems. </st><st c="7704">It is crucial to understand, however, that they are designed to address only </st><strong class="bold"><st c="7781">computable</st></strong><st c="7791"> problems. </st><st c="7802">This means that for a problem to be solvable by an algorithm, it must be one that can be resolved through a sequence of logical and mathematical steps. </st><st c="7954">In essence, a computable problem is one that can be systematically worked through using algorithms, which provide a clear and organized approach to finding </st><span><st c="8110">a solution.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="8121">One classic </st><a id="_idIndexMarker006" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="8134">example of a </st><strong class="bold"><st c="8147">non-computable problem</st></strong><st c="8169"> is the </st><strong class="bold"><st c="8177">halting problem</st></strong><st c="8192">. Posed by </st><a id="_idIndexMarker007" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="8203">Alan Turing, this problem asks whether it is possible to create an algorithm that can determine whether any given program and its input will halt (stop running) or continue to run indefinitely. </st><em class="italic"><st c="8397">Turing proved that no such algorithm can exist</st></em><st c="8443">; it is impossible for a general algorithm to predict the behavior of all possible program-input combinations and determine whether they will halt. </st><st c="8592">This is because the algorithm would have to account for an infinite number of possible program behaviors, which is </st><span><st c="8707">not feasible.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="8720">A classic example of a computable problem is sorting a list of numbers. </st><st c="8793">For instance, given a list of numbers, such as </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="8840">[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]</st></strong><st c="8861">, a sorting algorithm can rearrange these numbers in a specific order, such as ascending: </st><strong class="source-inline"><st c="8951">[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]</st></strong><st c="8972">. Sorting problems are computable because they have a well-defined procedure or set of steps that can be followed to achieve the sorted list, and this process will work for any finite list </st><span><st c="9161">of numbers.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="9172">Having established a basic understanding of the types of problems that can be solved using algorithms, we are now ready to explore the major problem-solving approaches employed in algorithm design. </st><st c="9371">However, it is important to address a common misconception first. </st><st c="9437">Some textbooks present heuristics and algorithmic approaches as opposites, but the relationship between them is more complementary </st><span><st c="9568">than contradictory.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="9587">He</st><a id="_idTextAnchor017" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="9590">uristic methods, as we will discuss in </st><a href="B22248_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor149" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic"><st c="9630">Chapter 10</st></em></span></a><st c="9640">, provide practical, often quicker solutions grounded in experience, intuition, or common-sense rules. </st><st c="9743">Their main advantage lies </st><a id="_idIndexMarker008" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="9769">in their speed and practicality, but this comes with a trade-off: heuristics do not always guarantee an optimal or correct solution. </st><st c="9902">On the other hand, an algorithmic approach follows a set of defined, structured steps leading to a definite solution, which is often the most optimal for the problem at hand. </st><st c="10077">Based on mathematical and logical procedures, algorithmic methods offer predictability, repeatability, and guaranteed outcomes, making them reliable in situations where accuracy is paramount. </st><st c="10269">As we will explore in detail in </st><a href="B22248_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor149" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic"><st c="10301">Chapter 10</st></em></span></a><st c="10311">, heuristics and algorithms have a symbiotic relationship. </st><st c="10370">While each has its own strengths and weaknesses, they can often complement each other to effectively tackle a wide range of problems. </st><st c="10504">Understanding when and how to use each approach is a key skill in the art of </st><span><st c="10581">algorithm design.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor018" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="10598">The rationale for algorithm analysis</st></h1>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="10635">In the last two decades, we have witnessed extraordinary advancements in advanced computational </st><a id="_idIndexMarker009" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="10732">systems, particularly in fields such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Robotics, and Computer Vision. </st><st c="10866">This progress owes more to two significant revolutions in the tech world and information </st><a id="_idIndexMarker010" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="10955">society than to improvements in algorithm design. </st><st c="11005">The first revolution was the availability of vast amounts of data following the public release of the Internet in 1991. </st><st c="11125">The second was the tremendous advancements in hardware, including </st><a id="_idIndexMarker011" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="11191">the development of powerful yet affordable processors such as </st><strong class="bold"><st c="11253">Graphical Processing Units</st></strong><st c="11279"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="11281">GPUs</st></strong><st c="11285">) and the creation of ultra-high-capacity memory and </st><span><st c="11339">storage solutions.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="11357">Despite these remarkable improvements in computational resources, the study and analysis of algorithms remain critically important for </st><span><st c="11493">several reasons:</st></span></p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="11509">Algorithm correctness</st></strong><st c="11531">: Irrespective of the abundance of computational resources, it is vital to mathematically prove an algorithm’s correctness in all scenarios. </st><st c="11673">Demonstrating effectiveness through examples is not sufficient; a mathematical framework is needed for rigorous proof. </st><st c="11792">This ensures the reliability of the algorithm across various conditions </st><span><st c="11864">and inputs.</st></span></li>
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="11875">Algorithm efficiency</st></strong><st c="11896">: Algorithm analysis is key to understanding the efficiency of different algorithms. </st><st c="11982">By examining time and space complexity, we can select or design algorithms that are not only faster bu</st><a id="_idTextAnchor019" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="12084">t also more resource-efficient. </st><st c="12117">This is especially important in environments with limited resources or when dealing with large datasets. </st><st c="12222">Furthermore, when several algorithms are available for the same task, analysis aids in making informed decisions about which </st><span><st c="12347">to use.</st></span></li>
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="12354">Better problem-solving skills</st></strong><st c="12384">: Deep knowledge of how algorithms function and how to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker012" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="12440">analyze them improves problem-solving capabilities. </st><st c="12492">This involves methodically breaking down problems into smaller components and devising optimal solutions, a skill valuable in many areas </st><span><st c="12629">beyond computing.</st></span></li>
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="12646">Understanding limitations</st></strong><st c="12672">: Understanding an algorithm’s limitations is as important as finding the most efficient solution. </st><st c="12772">Algorithm analysis helps recognize what problems an algorithm can or cannot solve effectively, which is crucial when dealing with time, memory, or specific data </st><span><st c="12933">structure constraints.</st></span></li>
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="12955">Preparing for future challenges</st></strong><st c="12987">: The landscape of technology and data is continuously evolving, growing in size and complexity. </st><st c="13085">A solid foundation in algorithm analysis equips us to effectively face and tackle these emerging </st><span><st c="13182">computational challenges.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="13207">Hence, we can say that while technological advancements have significantly boosted computational power, the relevance of algorithm analysis persists, ensuring that we continue to develop solutions that are not just fast but also correct, efficient, and suited to the ever-evolving complexities of </st><span><st c="13505">modern problems.</st></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><st c="13521">Let’s conduct a thought experiment. </st><st c="13558">Imagine a scenario where computational resources are limitless, with incredibly fast processors and virtually free memory. </st><st c="13681">Consider an array, </st><em class="italic"><st c="13700">A</st></em><st c="13701">, containing a very large number of elements, </st><em class="italic"><st c="13747">n</st></em><st c="13748">.

			<p class="calibre3"><st c="14462">In this </st><a id="_idIndexMarker014" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/><st c="14471">book, we explore four primary algorithmic problem-solving methods, each with its unique advantages, limitations, and applicability to different types </st><span><st c="14621">of problems:</st></span></p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="14633">Sequential or straightforward approach</st></strong><st c="14672">: This method is the most fundamental form of problem-solving. </st><st c="14736">It involves a linear sequence of instructions, often including loops and decision points. </st><st c="14826">While sequential algorithms are relatively simple to test and debug, they can be computationally expensive, making them less efficient for </st><span><st c="14965">complex tasks.</st></span></li>
				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="14979">Divide-and-conquer</st></strong><st c="14998">: This approach tackles a problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. </st><st c="15096">Each subproblem is solved independently, and then their solutions are combined to address the original, larger problem. </st><st c="15216">However, converting a sequential algorithm into a divide-and-conquer strategy is not always advantageous. </st><st c="15322">A classic example of where it might not be beneficial is the factorial problem, where the sequential approach is more straightforward (see </st><a href="B22248_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor051" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic"><st c="15461">Chapter 4</st></em></span></a><span><st c="15470">).</st></span></li>

			<p class="calibre3"><st c="16621">Now that we’ve established our expectations from this book, the primary question remains: what do we seek from algorithm analysis? </st><st c="16753">While “analysis” can encompass a broad spectrum of concepts, in this context, it specifically pertains to the crucial goals of designing efficient algorithms. </st><st c="16912">Firstly, we aim to develop algorithms that are absolutely correct, meaning they consistently produce the expected results. </st><st c="17035">Secondly, we strive to design algorithms that are as cost-effective as possible. </st><st c="17116">Therefore, in the process of algorithm analysis, we concentrate on two key dimensions: correctness </st><span><st c="17215">and cost.</st></span></p>

				<li class="calibre13"><strong class="bold"><st c="17598">Termination</st></strong><st c="17610">: An algorithm must always conclude after a finite number of steps. </st><st c="17679">It should not fall into perpetual loops or continue indefinitely, regardless of the </st><span><st c="17763">input provided.</st></span></li>
