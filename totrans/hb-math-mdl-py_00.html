<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Mathematical modeling is the art of transforming a business problem into a clear mathematical formulation. For a given problem or use case, the algorithmic implementation of a model helps optimize parameters and generate better insights and comprehension to enable decision-making. A mathematical model complements a machine learning model and supports high-stake decisions in sensitive domains such as medicine, <span class="No-Break">for example.</span></p>
<p>There are three focal topics to help you understand <span class="No-Break">mathematical modeling:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Areas where a mathematical model is useful – for example, control engineering and signal processing</li>
<li>Tested Python-based mathematical tools – for example, graph theory and MCMC</li>
<li>Underlying algorithms of mathematical optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>I will provide concepts of mathematical modeling and various approaches to modeling through this book. I will guide you in choosing the optimal technique and best-suited algorithm to solve a business problem using Python, based on two main sources <span class="No-Break">of information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>My experience from the past 5 years as a data scientist and application developer for businesses</li>
<li>My academic research (at different stages of maturity) across science disciplines for a decade</li>
</ul>
<p>As a data professional, I believe mathematical models (equation-driven) with objectives and constraints in a problem are as relevant as (data-driven) machine learning models. In some cases, the right combination of both yields the <span class="No-Break">best solutions.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>Data scientists, research and development professionals, and business scientists, in general, can gain practical insights into mathematical modeling with Python from <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<p>It is assumed that you have knowledge of <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Differential equations</li>
<li>Linear algebra</li>
<li>Basics of statistics</li>
<li>Data types and data structures</li>
<li>Numerical algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn about the relevance of mathematical models, how interpretability must be factored into models while solving a business problem, and how mathematical optimization and tuning machine learning models are important to arrive at the optimal solution. You will also learn how to choose a model, keeping in mind the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the underlying algorithm per the <span class="No-Break">business case.</span></p>

<p>In this part, you will get to know the theory behind mathematical modeling. You will be introduced to the concepts of a mathematical model and how they are relevant in solving a business problem. A mathematical model relies heavily on domain knowledge, the objective of the business case formulated into a mathematical problem, and constraints in the context, while a machine learning (statistical) model relies on data. Mathematical modeling is complementary to machine learning; for some use cases, one is enough, whereas a few others need a blend of <span class="No-Break">the two.</span></p>
<p>This part has the <span class="No-Break">following chapters:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="B18943_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Mathematical Modeling</em></li>
