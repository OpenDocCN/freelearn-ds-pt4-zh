- en: Mathematical modeling is the art of transforming a business problem into a clear
    mathematical formulation. For a given problem or use case, the algorithmic implementation
    of a model helps optimize parameters and generate better insights and comprehension
    to enable decision-making. A mathematical model complements a machine learning
    model and supports high-stake decisions in sensitive domains such as medicine,
    for example.

    objectives and constraints in a problem are as relevant as (data-driven) machine
    learning models. In some cases, the right combination of both yields the best
    solutions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this part, you will get to know the theory behind mathematical modeling.
    You will be introduced to the concepts of a mathematical model and how they are
    relevant in solving a business problem. A mathematical model relies heavily on
    domain knowledge, the objective of the business case formulated into a mathematical
    problem, and constraints in the context, while a machine learning (statistical)
    model relies on data. Mathematical modeling is complementary to machine learning;
    for some use cases, one is enough, whereas a few others need a blend of the two.
