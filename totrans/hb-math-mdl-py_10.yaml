- en: We discussed mathematical optimization techniques in the previous chapter and
    their necessity in business problems that require minimizing the cost (error)
    function and in predictive modeling, wherein the machine learns from historical
    data to predict the future. In **Machine Learning** (**ML**), the cost is a loss
    function or an energy function that is minimized. It can be challenging in most
    cases to know which optimization algorithm should be considered for a given ML
    model. Optimization is an iterative process to maximize or minimize an objective
    function and there is always a trade-off between the number of iteration steps
    taken and the computational hardship to get to the next step. In this chapter,
    hints of how to choose an optimization algorithm given a problem (hence, an objective)
    have been provided. The choice of optimization algorithm depends on different
    factors, including the specific problem to be solved, the size and complexity
    of the associated dataset, and the resources, such as computational power and
    memory, available.

    function where the derivative of this function is not available. Strictly speaking,
    optimization algorithms can be grouped into those that use derivatives and those
    that do not use derivatives. Optimization algorithms that rely on gradient descent
    are fast and efficient; however, they require well-behaved objective functions
    to work well. We can fall back on an exhaustive search if the function has tricky
    characteristics, but it takes an extremely long time (*Figure 10**.1*). There
    are optimization methods tougher than gradient descent, such as **Genetic Algorithms**
    (**GAs**) and simulated annealing. These take longer computational time and a
    greater number of steps than gradient descent, but they discover the optimal point
    even when it is very difficult to find.

    optimization, wherein the function’s input arguments are (real) numeric values.

    is explored in local optimization, which requires the knowledge of an initial
    approximation, as evident from *Figure 10**.2a*. If the objective function has
    local minima, then local search algorithms (gradient methods, for example) can
    also be stuck in one of the local minima. If the algorithm attains a local minimum,
    it is nearly impossible to reach the global minimum in the search space. In discrete
    search space, the neighborhood is a finite set that can be completely explored,
    while the objective function is differentiable (gradient methods, Newton-like
    methods) in continuous search space.

    the optima is known to exist within a specific range. They assume that a single
    optimum (unimodal objective function) is present in the known range of search
    space. These algorithms may sometimes even be used when the derivative information
    is unavailable. The bisection method of optimization is one such example.

    algorithms. The process in local descent involves choosing a direction for movement
    in the search space, then performing a bracketing search in a line or hyperplane
    in the chosen direction. Local descent is also called the line search algorithm;
    it is, however, computationally expensive to optimize each directional move in
    the search space. Gradient descent is a classic example of the line search algorithm.

    first-order optimization algorithms. First-order algorithms are generally referred
    to as gradient descent (or steepest descent). Unlike gradient descent, regularization
    algorithms use a predefined objective function. An ML model learns by minimizing
    an objective (cost function) and regularization is used on top of that when such
    a model overfits.

    learning rate, which is a hyperparameter controlling the distance of movement
    in the space (*Figure 10**.3*). Too small a step size leads to a long time to
    search for the optimum point, while too large a step size might lead to completely
    missing it. Optimizers have hyperparameters such as the learning rate, which can
    have a big impact on the performance of the ML model.

    and **Stochastic Gradient Descent** (**SGD**). Batch gradient descent computes
    the gradient with respect to the entire training dataset (all training examples),
    whereas SGD computes that with respect to each training example. A mini-batch
    performs an update for every (mini-) subset of training examples and hence takes
    the best of both worlds. A batch gradient descent can be very slow, whereas mini-batch
    gradient descent is very efficient. Mini-batch gradient descent is a good choice
    for problems with huge data. SGD performs frequent updates and hence the objective
    function fluctuates heavily, but it brings better convergence to the optimum.
    SGD is used to train artificial neural networks.

    algorithms, such as momentum, **Adaptive Gradient** (**AdaGrad**), and **Adaptive
    Moment Estimation** (**Adam**). Momentum, for example, is a method that helps
    accelerate SGD in the relevant direction (*Figure 10**.4*) for faster convergence.
    Methods such as adagrad and Adam compute adaptive learning rates for each parameter,
    helping the function converge quickly. However, Adam might be the best choice
    for sparse data. Adam uses both the gradient and second moment of the gradient.
    Adagrad is good for problems with very noisy data and ill-conditioned cost functions;
    that is; different dimensions of the cost function are not of the same scale.

    functions that have a single real variable, few of which show either the minimum
    or the maximum while optimizing but a saddle point in its domain (search space).

    at any given point in input space. The derivative (slope) is the rate of change
    of the function at that point. The Hessian is the rate at which the derivative
    of the function changes. Calculus helps optimize simple differentiable functions
    analytically. For differentiable objective functions, gradient-based optimization
    algorithms are used. However, there are objective functions for which the derivative
    cannot be computed, typically for very complex (noisy, multimodal, etc.) functions,
    which are called non-differentiable objective functions. There can be discontinuous
    objective functions as well, for which the derivatives can only be calculated
    in some regions of the search space. Stochastic and population algorithms handle
    such functions and are, hence, sometimes called black-box algorithms.

- en: Direct and stochastic optimization algorithms are used in problems where the
    derivative of the objective function is unknown or cannot be calculated, that
    is, the search space is discontinuous. The former algorithms are deterministic
    and assume the objective function is unimodal (it has a single global optimum).
    Direct search is often referred to as pattern search as it effectively navigates
    through the search space using geometric shapes. Gradient information is approximated
    from the objective function and used in initiating a line search in the search
    space, eventually (with repeated line searches) triangulating the region of optimum.
    Powell’s method is one example of a direct search algorithm. It is a gradient-free
    method because the function to be optimized with it is non-differentiable.

    search, hence the name. These typically involve sampling the objective function
    and can handle problems with deceptive local optima. Simulated annealing (*Figure
    10**.6*) is an example of a stochastic search algorithm, that is, of global optimization,
    which occasionally accepts poorer initial configurations. Simulated annealing
    is a probabilistic technique used to solve unconstrained and bound-constrained
    optimization problems. It is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization
    in a large search space of a physical process wherein the system energy is minimized.

    used for multimodal objective functions with multiple global optima and not-so-smooth
    (highly noisy) functions. These algorithms maintain a population of candidate
    solutions that add robustness to the search, thereby increasing the likelihood
    of overcoming local optima. The efficiency of these is very sensitive to the variables
    used in describing the problem. As with other heuristic algorithms, evolutionary
    algorithms have many degrees of freedom and, therefore, are difficult to tune
    for good model performance.

    of individuals in the population. These individuals make a generation, and a new
    generation is produced by randomly selecting a pair wherein the fitter individual
    is more likely to be chosen. GA is used to solve complex optimization problems
    by initialization (of the population), fitness assignment (to individuals in the
    population), and selection of the best (recombined) solution to the problem. A
    large community of researchers is working on GAs for utilization in most practical

    relevance of classical mathematical models and how they can be utilized along
    with ML models to solve business problems, often complex ones. Hybrid (blended)
    models enable better decision-making and become particularly essential for high-stake
    decisions in sensitive domains. Mathematical optimization typically elevates an
    ML model for the best interpretation of the connection between decision variables
    and relevant data and business objectives and of the optimal solution to the business
    problem. Nevertheless, simpler (pure or unblended) models are more often explainable,
    and while building complex ones, we need to look at the aspects of efficiency
