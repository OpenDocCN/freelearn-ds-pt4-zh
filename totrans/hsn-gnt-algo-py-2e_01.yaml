- en: In this section, you will be introduced to the key concepts of genetic algorithms,
    beginning with the Darwinian evolution analogy, basic principles, and theoretical
    foundations. We will then dive deeper into the components and implementation details
    of these algorithms, exploring their flow and various methods of selection, crossover,
    and mutation. The section also focuses on real-coded genetic algorithms and advanced
    concepts such as elitism, niching, and sharing, all setting the stage for problem-solving
    in subsequent sections.
