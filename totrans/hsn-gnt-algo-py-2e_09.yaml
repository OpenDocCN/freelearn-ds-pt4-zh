- en: This part focuses on using genetic algorithms to enhance various artificial
    intelligence tasks, including machine learning and natural language processing.
    It starts by showcasing how these algorithms can enhance supervised learning models
    through optimal feature selection for regression and classification tasks. We
    then explore the improvement of model performance through hyperparameter tuning,
    comparing traditional grid search methods with genetic algorithm approaches. We
    then shift our focus to the optimization of artificial neural network architectures,
    using the Iris dataset to illustrate the combined optimization of network structure
    and hyperparameters. In the realm of reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms
    are then applied to tackle Gymnasium’s MountainCar and CartPole challenges, while
    for natural language processing we see genetic algorithms in action solving a
    mystery word game and assisting in document classification. Finally, we examine
    the use of genetic algorithms in creating “what-if” scenarios in datasets, employing
    counterfactual analysis in Explainable AI and causality.
