    and introduces additional biologically inspired problem-solving techniques. The
    first chapter is dedicated to using genetic algorithms for image reconstruction,
    where an image is recreated using semi-transparent polygons, culminating in a
    genetic algorithm-based program that reconstructs a famous painting using these
    techniques. In the following chapter, the scope broadens to include genetic programming,
    **NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies** (**NEAT**), and particle swarm optimization,
    each demonstrated through Python-based problem-solving programs. We conclude with
    an overview of several other computational paradigms in this field, further expanding
    our understanding of evolutionary computation methods.
