- en: Most programmers and data scientists struggle with mathematics, either having
    overlooked or forgotten core mathematical concepts. This book helps you understand
    the math that's required to understand how various neural networks work so that
    you can go on to building better **deep learning** (**DL**) models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll begin by learning about the core mathematical and modern computational
    techniques used to design and implement DL algorithms. This book will cover essential
    topics, such as linear algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the singular value
    decomposition concept, and gradient algorithms, to help you understand how to
    train deep neural networks. Later chapters focus on important neural networks,
    such as the linear neural network, multilayer perceptrons, and radial basis function
    networks, with a primary focus on helping you learn how each model works. As you
    advance, you will delve into the math used for normalization, multi-layered DL,
    forward propagation, optimization, and backpropagation techniques to understand
    what it takes to build full-fledged DL models. Finally, you'll explore **convolutional
    neural network** (**CNN**), **recurrent neural network** (**RNN**), and **generative
    adversarial network** (**GAN**) models and their implementation.

    and DL mathematical concepts, which will help you to confidently research and
    build custom DL models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for data scientists, machine learning developers, aspiring DL developers,
    and anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of how DL algorithms work
    by learning the mathematical concepts that form their foundation. Having knowledge
    of the basics of machine learning is required to gain a better understanding of
    the topics covered in the book. Having a strong mathematical background is not
    essential but would be quite helpful in grasping some of the concepts.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is expected that most of you have had prior experience with implementing
    machine learning models and have at least a basic understanding of how they work.
    It is also assumed that many of you have some prior experience with calculus,
    linear algebra, probability, and statistics; having this prior experience will
    help you get the most out of this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those of you who do have prior experience with the mathematics covered in
    the first five chapters and have a background in machine learning, you are welcome
    to skip ahead to the content from [Chapter 7](e1f37008-1ad5-49f6-a229-4d6249c2d7e3.xhtml), *Feedforward
    Neural Networks*, onward and keep with the flow of the book from there.
  prefs: []

- en: However, for the reader who lacks the aforementioned experience, it is recommended
    that you stay with the flow and order of the book and pay particular attention
    to understanding the concepts covered in the first five chapters, moving on to
    the next chapter or section only when you feel comfortable with what you have
    learned. It is important that you do not rush or be hasty, as DL is a vast and
    complex field that should not be taken lightly.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, to become a very good DL practitioner, it is important that you keep
    learning and going over the fundamental concepts, as these can often be forgotten
    quite easily. After having gone through all the chapters in the book and through
    all the chapters, I recommend trying to read the code for and/or implementing
    a few architectures and trying to recall what you have learned in this book because
    doing so will help ground your concepts even further and help you to learn much
    faster.
