<p>Now that we have got a taste of linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and optimization, it is time to move on to a very fascinating topic, known as graph theory. This involves, as the name suggests, the study of graphs, which we use to model relationships between objects. We use these graphs to help visualize and analyze problems, which in turn helps us solve them. </p>
<p>Graph theory is a very important field and is used for a variety of problems, including page ranking in search engines, social network analysis, and in a GPS to find the best route home. It is also important for us to further our understanding of deep neural networks since the majority of them are based on a type of graph known as a <strong>directed acyclic graph</strong> (<strong>DAG</strong>). </p>
<p>Covering everything in graph theory goes beyond the scope of this chapter (and this book), but we will cover everything that is important for developing a deeper understanding of neural networks.</p>
<p>The topics that are covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the basic concepts and terminology </li>
<li>Adjacency matrix</li>
<li>Types of graphs</li>
<li>Graph Laplacian</li>
</ul>

<p>Graph theory was first introduced in the 18th century by Leonhard Euler to solve a famous problem known as the <strong>Königsberg bridge problem</strong>, which asks whether it is possible to walk around the <span>Königsberg bridge while crossing over each of the seven bridges exactly once. The bridge looks as follows:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037 image-border" src="Images/bd858c4c-fd3e-4815-9e1c-f6c3bbff3541.png" style="width:34.00em;height:15.75em;"/></p>
<p>Before we move on, try it out for yourself by using your finger to trace along the path or draw it and trace it with a pencil. Did you manage to find a solution? It's alright if you didn't! </p>
<p>Let's stop for a moment and ask ourselves what exactly a graph is. A graph (<em>G</em>) is a mathematical structure made up of two sets—<span>vertices</span><span> (</span><em>V(G)</em><span>) and </span><span>edges</span><span> (</span><em>E(G)</em><span>). Two vertices (</span><em>v<sub>1</sub></em><span> and</span> <em>v<sub>2</sub></em><span>) are connected if there is an edge (</span><em>e</em><span> or</span> <em>(v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>)</em><span>) between them. Now that that's settled, there are some rules associated with graphs that are important to our understanding of them. They are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/73ef2410-22d1-4e17-b7c5-e785edf5b06b.png" style="width:8.17em;height:1.42em;"/></sub>, then <em>v<sub>1</sub></em><span> and <em>v<sub>2</sub></em></span> are adjacent (connected/neighbors); but if <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/9345c28f-6993-4c90-9d00-1ab2c3b6518a.png" style="width:7.17em;height:1.25em;"/></sub>, then <em>v<sub>1</sub></em><span> and <em>v<sub>2</sub></em></span><span> are non-adjacent (not connected/not neighbors). </span></li>
<li>If <em>v<sub>1</sub></em> is adjacent to <em>v<sub>2</sub></em>, then we can say that the neighborhood of <em>v<sub>1</sub></em> (denoted as <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/da83ba4f-80bf-4c35-b505-55d3fc1b13c4.png" style="width:2.50em;height:1.17em;"/></sub>) is the set of vertices that are connected to <em>v<sub>1</sub></em>. We write this as <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/0dd6ac04-174c-472d-8552-a82d6d88db89.png" style="width:16.58em;height:1.17em;"/></sub>.</li>
<li>If <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/3378ba88-e0e4-4bc0-b85d-22919dc75865.png" style="width:9.50em;height:1.33em;"/></sub>, then <img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/0138795d-1306-41f3-bc97-7ab2162451a0.png" style="width:0.67em;height:0.92em;"/> is incident to <em>v<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>v<sub>2</sub></em> (that is,<span> <em>v<sub>1</sub></em></span><span> and <em>v<sub>2</sub></em></span><span> are <img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/680b9810-2665-42aa-914b-9e3dd5345afc.png" style="width:0.67em;height:0.92em;"/>'s endpoints</span>).</li>
<li>If <em>G</em> has <em>n</em> vertices, then <em>v<sub>1</sub></em> can have, at most, <em>n-1</em> neighbors.</li>
<li>If <em>v<sub>1</sub></em> has neighbors, then the degree of <em>v<sub>1</sub></em> is the number of neighbors (or incidences) it has. We can write this as <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/66cf6e82-e339-478c-89a1-9c5122456125.png" style="width:8.17em;height:1.25em;"/></sub>. The minimum degree of a vertex in the graph is denoted as <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/d4013c4b-a0a4-467e-93fd-0c2bb66369ad.png" style="width:2.25em;height:1.33em;"/></sub> and the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph is denoted as <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/7820024d-0549-400d-a711-8e7b7c5b5f79.png" style="width:2.25em;height:1.08em;"/></sub>. </li>
<li>If <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/cd56360c-ca05-46be-b207-51fa5e0bdd8f.png" style="width:6.42em;height:1.50em;"/></sub>, then it is an isolated vertex.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know what the fundamental rules of graphs are, let's revisit the preceding problem we introduced and see if we can work out its solution. We can redraw the bridge problem as a graph, as in the following diagram (refer to the color version provided in the graphics bundle):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1038 image-border" src="Images/a56d7c27-f3e2-45dd-a04e-9de4073e6d25.png" style="width:15.92em;height:12.50em;"/></p>
<p>Here, we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The green vertex is <em>A</em></li>
<li>The red vertex is <em>B</em></li>
<li>The blue vertex is <em>C</em></li>
<li>The orange vertex is <em>D</em></li>
<li>The curved edge connecting <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> is bridge <em>a</em></li>
<li>The straight edge connecting <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> is bridge <em>b</em></li>
<li>The curved edge connecting <em>A</em> and <em>C</em> is bridge <em>c</em></li>
<li>The straight edge connecting <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> is bridge <em>d</em></li>
<li>The straight edge connecting <em>A</em> and <em>D</em> is bridge <em>e</em></li>
<li>The straight edge connecting <em>B</em> and <em>D</em> is bridge <em>f</em></li>
<li>The straight edge connecting <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> is bridge <em>g</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If we look at the graph and traverse over the edges, we can easily observe that there is no solution to the <span>Königsberg bridge problem, regardless of what path we take. However, if we were to add an extra path from <em>D</em> to <em>A</em>, <em>D</em> to <em>B</em>, or <em>D</em> to <em>C</em>, then we do in fact have a solution to this problem.</span></p>
<p>Now, let's suppose we have a bunch of polyhedrons. In geometry, polyhedra are three-dimensional objects, such as tetrahedrons (pyramids), cubes, dipiramids, deltoidals, dodecahedrons, pentagonal hexacontahedrons, and so on (don't worry, you don't need to know what all of them are). In the following diagram, we have two different polyhedrons, along with their corresponding graphs:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039 image-border" src="Images/2c8c0ab5-4e1d-47fc-b30d-8d42d48024e4.png" style="width:22.25em;height:24.08em;"/></p>
<p>Let's observe the shapes and their graphs for a moment. As you can see, the graph looks a bit different from the actual structure but still captures the properties of the shape. Each graph here has vertices (<em>V</em>) and edges (<em>E</em>), which we already know. But there is one additional property—faces (<em>F</em>). Using the preceding diagrams, we can deduce a general rule that captures the relationships between the vertices, edges, and faces. It is as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/7e87d716-137e-4267-8f0f-bf8042fe9ae1.png" style="width:7.33em;height:1.00em;"/></p>
<p>Here, |<em>V</em>| = <em>n</em>, |<em>E</em>| = <em>m</em>, and |<em>F</em>| = <em>r</em>. To verify this, let's take a look at the preceding graphs. </p>
<p>In the case of the cube, there are 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces, so we have the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/c370e747-b1f3-49e7-aa96-f005809f37a4.png" style="width:17.00em;height:1.08em;"/></p>
<p>In the case of the octahedron, there are 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces, so we have the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/0bf004ea-4692-49e5-a9c8-0361c1d8f161.png" style="width:16.92em;height:1.08em;"/></p>
<p>Now that we understand<span> the basics, it is time for us to learn about what is often referred to as the first theorem in graph theory. Suppose we have a graph that has</span> <em>n</em><span> vertices and</span> <em>m</em><span> edges. Then, we can observe the following:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/d5cbcc94-dcf6-49de-b108-cc27dca1de6d.png" style="width:19.25em;height:1.33em;"/></p>
<p>This tells us that the sum of the degrees of each vertex of the graph is twice the number of edges in the graph. Alternatively, we can write this as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/4ad3a689-993d-4aab-8b17-6a4d00c4f0af.png" style="width:6.67em;height:2.42em;"/></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As you can imagine, writing down all the pairs of connected nodes (that is, those that have edges between them) to keep track of the relationships in a graph can get tedious, especially as graphs can get very large. For this reason, we use what is known as the adjacency matrix, which is the fundamental mathematical representation of a graph. </p>
<p>Let's suppose we have a graph with <em>n</em> nodes, each of which has a unique integer label (<sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/53ea9237-a078-40ef-9b41-885f16fa745a.png" style="width:4.67em;height:1.42em;"/></sub>) so that we can refer to it easily and without any ambiguity whatsoever. For the sake of simplicity, in this example, <em>n </em>= 6. Then, this graph's corresponding adjacency matrix is as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1215 image-border" src="Images/a6943f34-cf84-43b5-a5d2-f057eddbbdb1.png" style="width:14.50em;height:10.17em;"/></p>
<p>Let's take a look at the matrix for a moment and see why it is the way it is. The first thing that immediately pops out is that the matrix has a size of 6 × 6 (or <em>n</em> <span>× <em>n</em></span>) because size is important to us. Next, we notice that it is symmetric and there are only zeros along the diagonal. But why? What is the significance of it being written this way? </p>
<p>If we look at the diagram of the graph in the preceding section, we can see that the edges are as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/7861fc62-3732-4635-85f3-fd61e397b284.png" style="width:21.58em;height:1.42em;"/></p>
<p>Looking back at the matrix at either the upper triangle or lower triangle, we can see that there are seven 1s at specific <em>(i, j)</em> locations. Each 1 represents an edge between two numbered nodes, and there is a 0 if there is no edge between the two nodes. We can generalize this and write the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/7e646d82-108f-42bb-a5c5-dc803e962cf9.png" style="width:26.83em;height:3.17em;"/></p>
<p>The reason for there only being zeros along the diagonal is that there are no self-edges; that is, no node has a connection back to itself. This is referred to as a simple graph. However, there are also more complex graphs, such as those with self-edges and multi-edges. </p>
<p>The difference between graphs with multi-edges and simple graphs is that there can be one or more edges between a pair of nodes in a multi-edge graph. To get a clearer understanding of this, let's consider the following adjacency matrix, where we can see that there are now self-edges and multiple edges between pairs of nodes:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/20d57bb8-b98d-4c6f-a44f-e416d609f4ef.png" style="width:12.17em;height:8.50em;"/></p>
<p>There are some notable differences in this adjacency matrix compared with that of the simple graph. The first thing we notice is that the matrix no longer consists of just ones (1) and zeroes (0). What do you think the numbers represent? In this adjacency matrix, a double-edge between two nodes is written as <em>A<sub>i,j</sub></em> = <em>A<sub>j,i</sub></em> = 2. Self-edges, on the other hand, are those that go from <em>i</em> to <em>i</em>; that is, we can write this as <em>A</em><sub><em>i,i</em></sub> and it is equal to 2. The reason for it being equal to 2 and not 1 is that the edge is connected to <em>i</em> at both ends (and it also makes things easier when doing calculations).</p>

<p>In the previous section, we learned about the basics of graph theory, and as you saw, this is a very powerful mathematical tool that can be used for a plethora of tasks in various fields. However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution and so we need additional tools to help us because each problem is unique. In this section, we will learn about the various types of graphs and their use cases and strengths. This includes weighted graphs, directed graphs, multilayer graphs, dynamic graphs, and tree graphs.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>So far, we have seen graphs that have a sort of binary representation, where 1 represents the existence of an edge between two nodes and 0 signifies that there is no connection between two edges. We have also seen graphs that have self-edges and multiple edges. However, sometimes we may want to represent the strength between the two nodes instead, which we represent as a weight. The greater the weight, the greater the strength. </p>
<p>These sorts of graphs can be used in a variety of settings, such as in social networks where the weight represents how frequently two people communicate with each other, which we can use to determine their closeness. In the adjacency matrix for a weighted graph, each <em>A<sub>i,j</sub></em> instance represents the weight between nodes <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>. </p>
<p>Let's suppose we have the following adjacency matrix:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/023e1dd5-8f3f-4061-be40-cda7ef3054ba.png" style="width:7.67em;height:4.17em;"/></p>
<p>We can see that the weight (or strength) between nodes 1 and 2 is twice that of the weight between nodes 1 and 3, and the weight between nodes 2 and 3 is four times that between nodes 1 and 3. </p>
<p>The weight on these edges doesn't necessarily have to represent how strong the connection between two nodes is; it could also represent the time it takes to travel from one node to another or the distance between two nodes. </p>

<p>The difference between regular graphs and directed graphs is that the edges in regular graphs could go in either direction, which is why the adjacency matrix was symmetric. So, if there is an edge between node <em>i</em> and node <em>j</em>, then we can go from <em>i</em> to <em>j</em> or from <em>j</em> to <em>i</em>. However, in the case of directed graphs, the edges have a direction. These edges are directed edges and can only go in one direction. </p>
<p>The adjacency matrix for this type of graph is as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/ee858687-837e-43d6-9630-0f9ac1d45772.png" style="width:18.25em;height:2.75em;"/></p>
<p>Now, suppose we have the following graph:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040 image-border" src="Images/70fcaab7-b1a3-4285-af12-dae3794cccdc.png" style="width:15.50em;height:10.92em;"/></p>
<p>Then, its corresponding adjacency matrix is as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/3866f9cf-12bd-4530-aac1-a8f379a4208e.png" style="width:12.17em;height:8.50em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">As you can see, this matrix is asymmetric (not symmetric). For example, node 3 goes to node 2 and node 6 goes to node 4, but they don't ever go in the opposite direction. </p>
<p class="mce-root">As in the case of undirected networks, directed networks, too, can have multiple edges and self-edges. However, in this case, if there is a self-edge, then the element along the diagonal will hold a value of 1 instead of 2.</p>

<p class="mce-root">A DAG is a type of directed graph that doesn't have cycles in it. What this means is that there are no closed loops; that is, three or more nodes in a similar direction. So, suppose we have the following adjacency matrix:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/d7c3aa9f-7a7c-43dd-b24d-2ce81fc347be.png" style="width:10.00em;height:6.08em;"/></p>
<p>We can see, in the preceding adjacency matrix, that we have an edge from node 1 to node 3, an edge from node 3 to node 4, and an edge from node 4 to node 1. This creates a cycle within the graph. </p>
<p>Visually, you can think of a DAG as having a hierarchy where nodes can flow downward or upward through subsequent levels. So, if our edges are all directed upwards, none of the nodes will ever point from a higher level back to a lower level. But if this is the case, our network could go on forever, so where does this graph end? Surely there must be at least one node that has incoming edges, but none outgoing. </p>
<p>To determine whether our network is acyclic, we can use a simple procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a node that does not have any outgoing edges.</li>
<li>If a node such as this does not exist, then the graph is acyclic. However, if there is a node like this, then remove it and its incoming edges from the graph.</li>
<li>If all of these nodes have been removed, then the graph is acyclic. Else start from <em>Step 1</em> again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, the adjacency matrix for this type of graph is rather interesting. Suppose we number all our nodes so that the edges point from higher-numbered nodes to lower-numbered nodes. Then, its adjacency matrix will be strictly triangular with zeros along the diagonal. If we have the following adjacency matrix, we can clearly observe that there are no self edges and this will always be true for acyclic graphs:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1282 image-border" src="Images/cf23ac45-4db9-40e4-b4a9-ca5a3df229a0.png" style="width:18.67em;height:14.17em;"/></p>
<p><span>It is very important that we notice why this adjacency matrix is strictly triangular. It is because of the ordering (numbering) of the nodes. If this is not done properly, we will not have a triangular matrix. Curiously, there is always at least one ordering of nodes that results in an upper-triangular matrix, and it can be found using the preceding three-step procedure. </span></p>

<p>Often, we use graphs to map very complex relationships. So, suppose we wanted to create a graph for all the modes of transportation and the routes, similar to how Google Maps give us routes that involve buses, trains, cars, planes, or even combinations of them. We could create something like this using a multilayer graph, where nodes represent airports, bus stops, train stations, and other transportation modes, whereas edges represent flights, routes, and so on. </p>
<p>We could just label the edges and nodes to describe what each one represents, but that could turn out quite messy. So, instead, we can use a multilayer graph, where each layer is its own network representing a particular type or class of nodes. These layers are then stacked on top of each other and there are interlinking edges connecting nodes in different layers. These multilayer edges could be used to represent nodes that are within a certain radius of each other:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041 image-border" src="Images/6bcf5c93-4d2f-471a-9aec-ae05bcf76115.png" style="width:14.08em;height:20.33em;"/></p>
<p>A particularly important subclass of multilayer networks is the multiplex graph where each layer has the same nodes, which could represent people, objects, places, and so on, but it has various types of edges representing different relationships. This is very useful in social networks where different people are related in different ways:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042 image-border" src="Images/c40da01f-d176-409f-b00c-85ab7a3e8db5.png" style="width:18.42em;height:17.75em;"/></p>
<p>Another subclass of multilayer graphs is the dynamic (or temporal) graph. The significance of these graphs is that their structure changes over time. These could either be a fixed number of nodes, where the edges keep changing or nodes can be added to or removed from the graph over time. </p>
<p>We can represent a multiplex graph mathematically using a set of <em>n</em> <span>× <em>n</em></span> adjacency matrices, <em>A<sup>α</sup></em>, where <em>α</em> represents the layer number or a time step (if it is a dynamic or temporal graph). We can write the elements of the matrices as <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/175e2cf3-60fa-4394-b30c-a02dde594502.png" style="width:1.67em;height:1.42em;"/></sub>. These elements form a three-dimensional tensor. In comparison, multilayer graphs are a lot more complicated because the number of nodes at each layer can differ and they have both intralayer and interlayer edges. We can represent the intralayer edges using adjacency matrices, <em>A<sup>α</sup></em>, where each layer, <em>α</em>, has an adjacency matrix with a size of <em>n<sub>α </sub></em>× <em>n<sub><span>α</span></sub></em>. The adjacency matrix for the interlayer edges, on the other hand, can be represented as <em>B<sup>α<span>β</span></sup></em> (which is of size <em>n<sub>α </sub></em><span>× </span><em>n</em><sub>β</sub>), where the matrices element is <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/60e6f2bc-8ed5-423d-9ca2-0b76df4f0cd5.png" style="width:3.58em;height:1.58em;"/></sub> if there is an edge between node <em>i</em> in layer <em><span>α</span></em> and node <em>j</em> and layer <em><span>β</span></em>. </p>

<p>Tree graphs are types of graphs that, as the name suggests, have a tree-like structure. They are undirected and do not have any loops. They also have a rather interesting property, referred to as <strong>connectedness</strong>, where we can find a path to any node on the graph from any other node.</p>
<p>In the following diagram, we can see what a tree graph looks like:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043 image-border" src="Images/96228fd6-4f3c-4765-b72d-ac58ff04262b.png" style="width:16.42em;height:21.50em;"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the graph starts at one node (the root node) and ends with leaf nodes. In between, they branch out to form smaller sub-trees. An interesting property is that a tree graph with <em>n</em> nodes has <em>n-1</em> edges.</p>

<p>Earlier in this chapter, in the <em>Adjacency matrix</em><span> </span><span>section</span><span>, we learned about the adjacency matrix and how we can use it to tell what the structure of a graph is. However, there are other ways of representing graphs in matrix form. </span></p>
<p>Now, let's suppose we have an undirected, unweighted graph. Then, its Laplacian matrix will be a symmetric <em>n</em> <span>× <em>n</em></span> matrix, <em>L</em>, whose elements are as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/1bba5a9d-78d4-4bc0-b5d1-2c2f82f38562.png" style="width:27.42em;height:4.00em;"/></p>
<p>Here, <sub><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/c5341f20-5d40-43bc-8f59-20d7d471a4bf.png" style="width:7.42em;height:1.67em;"/></sub>. We can also write this as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/26bb8b67-a30f-437b-b0a0-466e0683d8b3.png" style="width:8.58em;height:1.25em;"/></p>
<p>Here, <em>A<sub>i,j</sub></em> is the adjacency matrix and <em>δ<sub>i,j</sub></em> is the Kronecker delta. We can rewrite this in matrix form, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="fm-editor-equation" src="Images/31f0927b-ec76-4376-a0e2-55f912a9033e.png" style="width:5.08em;height:1.00em;"/></p>
<p>Here, we have the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 210px"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1216 image-border" src="Images/12698959-6e57-4a51-8eb9-245fedbc3c7d.png" style="width:10.83em;height:5.92em;"/></p>
<p>Similarly, we can also write the graph Laplacian matrix for a weighted graph by replacing the adjacency matrix here with the one we defined previously for weighted graphs.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned about a very fascinating topic in mathematics that has applications in nearly every field, from social sciences, to social networking, to the World Wide Web, to artificial intelligence—but particularly, in our case of neural networks.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn <span>about</span><span> </span><span>linear neural networks, which are the simplest type of neural networks and are used most frequently in statistical learning.</span></p>
