<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">When I was about to take my first mathematical analysis course at the university, coming straight from high school, I wondered why we would spend several lectures on real numbers. At the time, I was confident in my knowledge and thought that I knew what numbers were. This was my first painful encounter with the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Dunning–Kruger effect</span></a><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">: the less you know, the more confident you are. Suffice to say, after a few classes, I was left confused about numbers, taking a while to finally understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">If you look at numbers under a magnifying glass, they become extremely complex. In this chapter, we are going to make sense of them. To look ahead and keep machine learning in our sights, consider that gradient descent (you know, the optimization algorithm that is used </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">everywhere</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">) is not possible for functions that are not differentiable. In turn, a function </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">f </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is differentiable at </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">if the limit</span></p>
<div class="math-display">

</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">exists. To understand limits, we must understand real numbers first.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Another good reason to dig deep into the patterns and structures of numbers: they are beautiful (as said above by Paul Erdős, one of the greatest mathematicians ever). There is a particular joy to understanding seemingly familiar things on a deep level. Even though you might not use this knowledge every day, it teaches you perspective about the objects you encounter during your work.</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">There are five famous classes of numbers</span> <span id="dx1-161001"></span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">that one has to know in order to become adept in mathematics:</span></p>

<div class="math-display">
<img src="../media/file897.png" class="math-display" alt="ℕ := {1,2,3,...}. "/>
</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Sometimes 0 is included; sometimes it is not. Believe it or not, after a few</span> <span id="dx1-162001"></span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">thousand years, mathematicians still cannot decide whether or not </span>0 <span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is a natural number. This problem might sound comical, but trust me, I have seen senior professors almost get into a fistfight upon debating this issue. For some people, this is a religious question.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">I don’t particularly care, and neither should you. I propose using the more common and practical definition, which is the one without 0. When we really need to talk about the natural numbers AND 0, I will use the notation </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℕ</span><sub><span class="cmr-8">0</span></sub> = <span class="cmsy-10x-x-109">{</span>0<span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">,</span>1<span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">,</span>2<span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">,…</span><span class="cmsy-10x-x-109">}</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">The cardinality of the set of natural numbers is countably infinite. In fact, countability is defined as </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">j</span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℕ</span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">j</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">. (If you are not familiar with the concept of </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">cardinality</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, check out </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">Appendix C</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">.)</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">To be able to express negative and zero quantities, we extend natural numbers to obtain the set of </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">integers</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, defined by</span></p>
<div class="math-display">

</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">So far, so good. Integers are also countable: one can enumerate all of</span><span id="dx1-162002"></span> <span class="cmss-10x-x-109">its elements by</span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">One significant advantage of integers over natural numbers is that they contain the additive inverse for each element. In plain English, if </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span class="cmsy-10x-x-109">∈</span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℤ</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, then so does </span><span class="cmsy-10x-x-109">−</span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span class="cmsy-10x-x-109">∈</span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℤ</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">. This makes it possible to define all kinds of algebraic structures over the integers, giving us mathematical tools to reason about phenomena modeled by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Note that if </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n,m </span><span class="cmsy-10x-x-109">∈</span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℤ</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, then </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span>+ <span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">m </span><span class="cmsy-10x-x-109">∈</span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℤ</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">. In mathematical terminology, we say that </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℤ </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">closed to addition</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">To summarize, </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℤ </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">closed to addition,</span></li>
<li><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">and every element has an additive inverse.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">These two properties will guide us on how to go from natural numbers to real numbers. Each extension is constructed so that these two properties hold, but for different operations.</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">So, we</span> <span id="dx1-163001"></span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">obtained </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℤ </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">from </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℕ </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">by extending it with 0 and the additive inverses for each element. What about the multiplicative inverses? This idea leads us to the concept of </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">rational numbers</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, numbers that can be written as a ratio of two integers. It is defined by</span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">It is both closed to multiplication and every element (except 0) has a multiplicative inverse. This is not just a </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">l’art pour l’art </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">mathematical construction: rational numbers model quantities that are all around us. ”7.9 seconds” to ”100.0 km/h”. 78.4 kilograms to carry. 0.5 pizza to eat.

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">It might be surprising, but </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℚ </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is also countable.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">One easy way to prove this is to notice that it can be obtained as the countable union of countable sets:</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Since the union of</span> <span id="dx1-163002"></span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">countable sets is countable, </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℚ </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is countable as well. Another (and perhaps more visual) way to see this is to simply enumerate them in the sequence, illustrated by </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">Figure 10.1</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">.</span></p>

These threw a huge monkey wrench into the machinery of mathematics at the beginning of the 20th century.)</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Notice that real numbers break the pattern we observed previously. Integers were constructed by extending the natural numbers with additive inverses and closing them to addition; rationals were obtained the same way, except doing it for multiplication.

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">But what are limits? Let’s see – by studying sequences, the objects that provide the context of limits!</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">If you think about it for a minute, this is easy to see. The </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>= 0 <span class="cmss-10x-x-109">and </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>= 1 <span class="cmss-10x-x-109">cases are trivial.

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Similarly to the previous example, this can be shown with the use of logarithms.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmssbx-10x-x-109">Example 3. </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Let’s consider the sequences</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Convergence</span> <span id="dx1-169001"></span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is everywhere. You’ve just come across this concept for the first time, so you might not realize its importance just yet. However, it is central to mathematics and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Just to look ahead and give a few examples, </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">differentiation </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is defined by a limit:</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Regarding derivatives, </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">integrals </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">(the “inverse” of differentiation) are limits of convergent sequences. For instance,</span></p>
<div class="math-display">
<img src="../media/file950.png" class="math-display" alt="∫ 1 2 ∑n k2- 0 x dx = lni→m∞ n3. k=1 "/>
</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Because integrals are limits, so is every quantity calculated with integration, such as </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">expected values</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, like for the standard normal distribution,</span></p>
<div class="math-display">

</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Convergence is also central to probability and statistics.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">There are two famous theorems: the </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">law of large numbers</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, stating that</span></p>

They are both very important in machine learning and neural networks; for instance, the law of large numbers is one of the fundamental ideas behind stochastic gradient descent.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Even the</span> <span id="dx1-169002"></span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">gradient descent optimization process is a recursively defined sequence of model weights, converging toward an optimum where the model best fits the data.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">We will talk about all of these in detail. So, even if you don’t understand these right now, don’t worry. It’ll become clear soon.

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Now that we have</span> <span id="dx1-172001"></span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">familiarized ourselves with the concept of convergent sequences, we shall take another look at rational and real numbers.

Extending </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℤ </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">with multiplicative inverses </span>1<span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">∕n </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">for all </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">and closing it for multiplication yields </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℚ</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">. The pattern is seemingly different in the case of </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℝ</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, but this is not the case. After understanding what convergence is, we have the tools to see why.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Consider the following sequence:</span></p>
<div class="math-display">
<img src="../media/file969.png" class="math-display" alt=" 1 n an := (1+ n-) , n = 1,2,.... "/>
</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Since rational numbers are closed to addition and multiplication, we see that </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">a</span><sub><span class="cmmi-8">n</span></sub> <span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is rational. However,</span></p>
<div class="math-display">
<img src="../media/file970.png" class="math-display" alt="lim (1 + 1)n = e, n→∞ n "/>
</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">which is the famous Euler constant, is </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">not </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">rational.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Thus, we have found what is missing: </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℚ </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">is not closed to taking limits. So, we can obtain the set of real numbers by closing </span><span class="msbm-10x-x-109">ℚ </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">to taking limits.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">The fact that every irrational number can be approximated with rational numbers as close as possible is often under-appreciated. Think about this: can you represent all real numbers with a computer? Nope. This follows from a simple cardinality argument: the number of possible floats is finite, but there are uncountably many real numbers. However, certain numbers (like </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">π </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">or </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">e</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">) are essential in engineering calculations and simulations. Without approximations, working with irrational numbers would be unfeasible.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Speaking of </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">e</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">: how would you approximate it for computational purposes? In theory, it is enough to take a large enough </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">and use the value </span>(1 + 1<span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">∕n</span>)<sup><span class="cmmi-8">n</span></sup><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">. In practice, there are several potential problems: the convergence might be slow, and taking a large power of a quantity so close to </span>1 <span class="cmss-10x-x-109">can be numerically unstable.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">However, there is a solution: the form</span></p>
<div class="math-disply">
<img src="../media/file971.png" width="150" class="math-display" alt=" N e = lim ∑ -1 N→ ∞ n! n=0 "/>
</div>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">solves both of these problems! From a numerical point of view, addition is much better than multiplication. Moreover, as </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>! <span class="cmss-10x-x-109">grows extremely rapidly, the term</span> <img src="../media/file972.png" width="15" data-align="middle" alt=" 1 n!"/> <span class="cmss-10x-x-109">becomes negligible even for small </span><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">-s.

There, each pizza is packed in a box that contains a pizza coupon. Ten pizza coupons can be exchanged for a free pizza. This begs the question: how much pizza do you get with a single purchase?</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Immediately, you’ll receive a pizza.

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">This is quite wild. The Riemann rearrangement theorem states that if you give me an arbitrary real number, I can conjure a rearrangement that’ll change the value to the number you gave me.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">We won’t prove this either, but here is an intuitive explanation. Suppose that you want to rearrange the series to change its sum to </span>10<span class="cmss-10x-x-109">. You start putting the positive terms in descending order to the front, and when the partial sum overshoots </span>10<span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, you continue with the negative terms. When the partial sum undershoots </span>10<span class="cmss-10x-x-109">, you turn to positive values once more, and you keep repeating this until infinity. The property of conditional convergence guarantees that this method works.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Now that we are familiar with the subtle differences between absolute and conditional convergence, let’s turn to one of the burning questions we should have asked already: how do we know if a series is convergent or not?</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">As the product is calculated term by term, we have</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">However, we can sum the terms diagonally. By taking a look at the table</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">you can notice that the diagonals sum up to </span><span class="cmex-10x-x-109">∑</span> <sub><span class="cmmi-8">k</span><span class="cmr-8">=0</span></sub><sup><span class="cmmi-8">n</span></sup><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">a</span><sub><span class="cmmi-8">k</span></sub><span class="cmmi-10x-x-109">b</span><sub><span class="cmmi-8">n</span><span class="cmsy-8">−</span><span class="cmmi-8">k</span></sub><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">.

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Of course, this is not an exact proof, as we’ve used rearrangements without showing absolute convergence.</span></p>

<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">Until this chapter, our mathematical study was quite close to machine learning. Vectors, matrices, functions: they are all there at the ground zero of theory and practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">This time, however, we’ve gone far below the surface. We rarely work directly with sequences in practice, but despite appearances, they are all over the place, providing a solid theoretical foundation for everything that is quantitative.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">So, what did we learn? What numbers are, for one. Going from natural numbers to real numbers is nothing short of a revelation, allowing us to see the evolution of the concept of a </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">number</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">. But deep down, sequences hold the concept of numbers together. And whenever we talk about sequences, limits and convergence enter the picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">To summarize, gradient descent is about the limit of the sequence</span></p>

To see the full picture, we need to study differentiation and integration, or in other words, </span><span class="cmssi-10x-x-109">calculus</span><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">.</span></p>
<p><span class="cmss-10x-x-109">However, to get there, there’s one more step to take. It’s time to move beyond sequences and study the concept of limits in the context of functions!</span></p>
