- en: Python is a general-purpose programming language that's increasingly being used
    for data analysis and visualization. Matplotlib is a popular data visualization
    package in Python that's used to design effective plots and graphs. This book
    is a practical, hands-on resource to help you visualize data with Python using
    the Matplotlib library.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book shows you how to create attractive graphs, charts, and plots using
    Matplotlib. You will also get a quick introduction to the third-party packages
    Seaborn, pandas, Basemap, and Geopandas, and learn how to use them with Matplotlib.
    After that, you'll embed and customize your plots in third-party tools such as
    GTK+, Qt 5, and WXWIDGETS.

    help of the practical examples provided in this book. Further on, you'll explore
    Matplotlib 2.1.x on the web from a cloud-based platform using third-party packages
    such as Flask and Django. Finally, you will integrate interactive, real-time visualization
    techniques into your current workflow with the help of practical real-world examples.

- en: Welcome aboard to the journey of creating good data visuals. In this era of
    exploding big data, we are probably well aware of the importance of data analytics.
    Developers are keen to join the data mining game, and build tools to collect and
    model all kinds of data. Even for non-data analysts, information such as performance
    test results and user feedback is often paramount in improving the software being
    developed. While strong statistical skills surely set the foundation of successful
    software development and data analysis, good storytelling is crucial even for
    the best data crunching results. The quality of graphical data representation
    often determines whether or not you can extract useful information during exploratory
    data analysis and get the message across during the presentation.
