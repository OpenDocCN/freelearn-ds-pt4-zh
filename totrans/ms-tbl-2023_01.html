    <p class="normal">Tableau is one of the leading tools used to solve <strong class="keyWord">business intelligence</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">BI</strong>) and analytics challenges. With this book, you<a/> will master Tableau’s features and offerings in various paradigms of the BI domain. As an update to the successful <em class="italic">Mastering Tableau</em> series, this book covers the essential Tableau concepts, data preparation, and calculations with Tableau, all the way up to machine learning use cases.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This edition comes with new datasets, more examples of how to improve dashboard performance, and the most up-to-date know-how on data visualization, Tableau Server, and Tableau Prep Builder.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This new edition will also explore Tableau’s connections with Python and R, Tableau extensions, joins, and unions, and last but not least, three new use cases of powerful self-service analytics, time-series analytics, and geo-spatial analytics in order to implement the learned content. By the end of this book, you’ll have mastered the advanced offerings of Tableau and its latest updates, up to Tableau version 2023.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Those who are fairly new to Tableau should find this chapter helpful in getting up to speed quickly; however, since this book targets advanced topics, relatively little time is spent considering the basics. For a more thorough consideration of fundamental topics, consider <em class="italic">Learning Tableau, </em>written by Joshua Milligan and published by Packt Publishing.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we’ll discuss the following topics:</p>&#13;

<section id="ch01lvl1sec02">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Creating worksheets and dashboards</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">At the heart of Tableau are <strong class="keyWord">worksheets</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">dashboards</strong>. Worksheets contain individual visualizations<a/> and dashboards contain one or more worksheets. Additionally, worksheets and <a/>dashboards may be combined into <strong class="keyWord">stories</strong> to communicate particular insights to the end user through a presentation environment. Lastly, all worksheets, dashboards, and stories are organized in <strong class="keyWord">workbooks</strong>, which<a/> can be accessed using Tableau Desktop, Server, Reader, or the Tableau mobile app.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">At this point, I would like to introduce you to <strong class="keyWord">Tableau Public</strong> (<a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/discover" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://public.tableau.com/app/discover</span></a>). At times, you might need some inspiration, or you<a/> might want to replicate a dashboard created by another Tableau user. In this case, Tableau Public will be your place to go! It is a web-based collection of dashboards, as well as a creator’s platform that allows you to design beautiful dashboards without a license or installation.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You can create your own profile—registration is free—and share all the dashboards you’ve created that you think the world shouldn’t miss out on. The best part, however, is that you can download all of them, open them in your own version of Tableau, and start learning and replicating. Even without your own profile or registration, it is possible to download dashboards. In summary: Tableau Public is a free option but offers limited data source connectivity, data privacy, and feature availability. It does provide an excellent platform for sharing visualizations publicly though and brushing up on your Tableau skills without the need for a paid license.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this section, we’ll consider how to create worksheets and dashboards. Our intention here is to communicate the basics, but we’ll also provide some insight that may prove helpful to more seasoned Tableau users.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Creating worksheets</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Before creating a<a/> worksheet, we’ll need to create a visualization to populate it with. At the most fundamental level, a visualization in Tableau is created by placing one or more <strong class="keyWord">fields</strong> on one or more <strong class="keyWord">shelves</strong>. As an example, note that the visualization created in the following diagram is generated by placing <strong class="keyWord">Number of Records</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Text</strong> shelf on the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_01.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.1: The Marks card</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Having considered some basic theory, in the next subsection, you will get the chance to follow along in your own Tableau workbook. Let’s go!</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Creating a visualization</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now, let’s explore the basics of <a/>creating a visualization using an exercise:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Navigate to <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marleen.meier" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marleen.meier</span></a> to locate and download the workbook associated with this chapter.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Open the file by double-clicking on the downloaded workbook.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the workbook, find and select the tab labeled <strong class="keyWord">Fundamentals of Visualizations</strong>:</li>&#13;

    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="4">The dashboard is connected to two data sources; for this first exercise, we will use the <strong class="keyWord">Summer-Olympics</strong> data. Click on the data source <strong class="keyWord">Summer-Olympics </strong>in the<a/> top-left corner:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_03.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.3: Data source</p>&#13;

    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="7">Click on <strong class="keyWord">Color</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card and then on <strong class="keyWord">Edit Colors…</strong> to adjust the colors of your<a/> visualization as desired. This will allow you to edit the colors used in your visualization, and <strong class="keyWord">Transparency</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Border</strong> effects:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_06.png" alt="Graphical user interface&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.6: Edit Colors…</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="8">Now see what happens if you move <strong class="keyWord">Sport</strong> to the <strong class="keyWord">Size</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Label</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Detail</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Columns</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelves. After placing <strong class="keyWord">Sport</strong> on each shelf, you can click on each shelf individually to access additional options.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Drop other fields on various shelves to continue exploring Tableau’s behavior. One<a/> example could be, on an empty canvas, dragging <strong class="keyWord">Year</strong> to the <strong class="keyWord">Columns </strong>shelf, <strong class="keyWord">Number of Records</strong> to the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf, and <strong class="keyWord">Medal</strong> to <strong class="keyWord">Color</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card. You will now see the number of medals per medal type over time:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_07.png" alt="Chart, line chart&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.7: Medals over time</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="10">Did you come up with any interesting visualizations? Feel free to share them on Tableau Public. Add the tag <strong class="keyWord">#MasteringTableau</strong> if you want other readers of this book to find them—sharing is caring!</li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">As you explore Tableau’s behavior by dragging and dropping different fields onto different shelves, you’ll <a/>notice that Tableau responds with default behaviors. These defaults, however, can be overridden, which we’ll explore next.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Beyond the default behavior</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the preceding <a/>exercise, <em class="italic">Creating a visualization</em>, we can notice that the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card reads <strong class="keyWord">Automatic</strong>. This means that Tableau is providing the default view. The default view can easily be overridden by choosing a different selection from the drop-down menu:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_08.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.8: The Marks card drop-down menu</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">By changing these settings on the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card, we can adjust the format in which your data will be displayed.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Another type of <a/>default behavior can be observed when dragging a field onto a shelf. For example, dragging and dropping a measure onto a shelf will typically result in the <code class="inlineCode">SUM()</code> aggregation, which will sum up all the values to the highest level of aggregation. If no dimension is present, it will be the sum of all values. If a dimension is present on the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card, this same dimension will serve as the highest level of aggregation.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We will see an example of this behavior later in this section.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In Windows, you can override this default behavior by right-clicking and dragging a pill from the <strong class="keyWord">Data </strong>pane and dropping it onto a shelf. Tableau will respond with a dialog box with possible options:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_09.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.9: Changing the default aggregation</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you are working on macOS, you can right-click on the pill after you’ve dragged it to its location and then adjust the default behavior by changing the measure. This works on Windows as well. Another <a/>option is to right-click on the field while it is still in the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane on your left-hand side and select <strong class="keyWord">Default Properties</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Aggregation</strong>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now, let’s walk through an exercise where we’ll override another default behavior on the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">In the workbook associated with this chapter, navigate to the <strong class="keyWord">Overriding Defaults</strong> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Drag and drop <strong class="keyWord">Year </strong>from the data pane to the <strong class="keyWord">Columns</strong> shelf:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_10.png" alt="Graphical user interface&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with low confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.10: Year to Columns</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="3">Place <strong class="keyWord">Number of Records</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf (which is automatically aggregated to <strong class="keyWord">SUM(Number of Records)</strong>) and <strong class="keyWord">Sport </strong>on the <strong class="keyWord">Detail</strong> shelf.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the dropdown <a/>on the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card and select <strong class="keyWord">Area</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_11.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.11: Area chart</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Figure 1.11</em>, we can see the <strong class="keyWord">Number of Records</strong> over time (<strong class="keyWord">Year</strong>), where each line represents one type of <strong class="keyWord">Sport</strong>. We chose to visualize this in a stacked area chart.</p>&#13;
    <h4 class="heading-4">Sorting and nested sorting</h4>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now that you are familiar with<a/> the basics of dragging and dropping pills and are aware of Tableau’s default behavior, the next thing most users want to do is to sort the data to draw first conclusions, regarding, for example, minimum and maximum values.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Navigate to the <strong class="keyWord">Nested Sorting</strong> tab <a/>and try to sort the countries by the amount of medals won, but separately for gold, silver, and bronze.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Did it work for you? </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In Tableau, sorting and nested sorting can be done by simply clicking on the icon next to each column name:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_12.png" alt="Chart&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.12: Sorting</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To double-check the <a/>way of sorting, move your cursor onto the <strong class="keyWord">Country</strong> pile until the arrow appears in the right corner, click on the arrow next to a given field, in this case, <strong class="keyWord">Country</strong>, and select <strong class="keyWord">Sort…</strong>:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_13.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.13: Sort settings</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">From the <a/>dropdown, select <strong class="keyWord">Nested</strong> and the desired <strong class="keyWord">Field Name</strong>, as well as the <strong class="keyWord">Aggregation</strong> type:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_14.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.14: Nested Sort</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">After having completed and understood <strong class="keyWord">Sort</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Nested Sort</strong>, you will immediately be able to add value to your dashboards by presenting values in the most logical way. Now, we can move<a/> on to the next topic, the different default chart types Tableau comes with: <strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong>.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Show Me</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> can help users new<a/> to Tableau to create the visualization they are looking for, such as bar charts, histograms, and area charts. It allows the Tableau author to create visualizations from input data at the click of a button. To understand how it works, let’s refer to the following screenshot, which again makes use of the <strong class="keyWord">Overriding Defaults</strong> worksheet. This view can be accessed by clicking the <strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> button in the upper-right corner of any Tableau sheet:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_15.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.15: Show Me</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now let’s look at the following aspects that are highlighted in the preceding screenshot:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">A</strong>: Selected fields in the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">B</strong>: Fields deployed in the view, that is, pills</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">C</strong>: The recommended view, highlighted in the <strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> panel</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">D</strong>: Help text that communicates the requirements for creating the recommended view or any selection choice over which the cursor is placed</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Every icon in <strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> that isn’t grayed out represents a visualization that can be created simply by clicking on it. For example, in the preceding screenshot, <em class="italic">Figure 1.15</em>, the Tableau author may choose to click on the area chart icon to create an area chart based on the selected and deployed fields.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> options are<a/> highlighted based on two criteria: the selected fields in the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane and the fields deployed in the view.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> may be effectively used for the following reasons:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Efficiency</strong>: A proficient Tableau<a/> author already knows how to create the basic visualization types. <strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> automates these basic types and thus may be used for quicker production.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Inspiration</strong>: Determining an effective way to visualize a dataset can be challenging. <strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> can help with this challenge by allowing the Tableau author to quickly consider various options.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Education</strong>: An inexperienced Tableau author may access <strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> to better understand how various visualizations are created. By reading the help text displayed at the bottom of <strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> and changing the pill placement accordingly, much can be learned:</li>&#13;
    </ul><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_16.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.16: Show Me</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">These three reasons demonstrate the strong capabilities that <strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> provides for worksheet creation; however, be careful not to use it as a crutch. If you click on the various options without understanding how each visualization is created, you’re not only shortchanging the<a/> educational process but you may also generate results that you don’t understand and hence cannot explain to your stakeholders.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Once you are happy with the results and confident that the selected visualization puts enough emphasis on your data storytelling, your worksheet is ready for the next round of development. We’ve looked at some basic visualization creation and configuration techniques, so let’s now look at how to group multiple worksheets into a dashboard.</p>&#13;
    <div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">Data storytelling is the art of using data to create a compelling story through visualizations such as graphs and charts. It combines the power of data analytics with storytelling techniques to convey complex information in an engaging and understandable way.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Creating dashboards</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Although, as stated <a/>earlier in this section, a dashboard contains one or more worksheets, dashboards are much more than just static presentations. They’re an essential part of Tableau’s interactivity. In this section, we’ll populate a dashboard with worksheets and then deploy actions for interactivity.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s begin by building a dashboard.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Building a dashboard</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The following are the steps for <a/>building a dashboard:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">In the workbook for this chapter, navigate to the <strong class="keyWord">Building a Dashboard</strong> tab.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="keyWord">Dashboard</strong> pane, located on the left side of the <em class="italic">Figure 1.17</em>, double-click on each of the following worksheets (in the order in which they are listed) to add them to the dashboard pane: <strong class="keyWord">Count of Disciplines</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Attendees</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Medals</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">Medal Shapes</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_17.png" alt="Graphical user interface, chart&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.17: Creating a dashboard</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="3">In the <a/>bottom-right corner of the dashboard, click in the blank area (indicated by an arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 1.18</em>) to select a <strong class="keyWord">container</strong>. Containers are a selection of sheets that auto-adjust to fit next to/underneath each other on your dashboard:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_18.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.18: Deleting a container</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="4">After clicking in the blank area, you should see a blue border around the filter and the<a/> legends. This indicates that the vertical container is selected. Select the vertical container handle and delete it by clicking the <strong class="keyWord">X</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">A selected container can also be dragged to a different location on the dashboard, replacing an existing sheet or sharing space. Note the gray shading in <em class="italic">Figure 1.19</em>, which communicates where the selection will be placed. Drag the <strong class="keyWord">Attendees</strong> worksheet by selecting and holding the handle and put it on top of the <strong class="keyWord">Count of Disciplines</strong> worksheet in order to swap the two:&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_19.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.19: Moving worksheets</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The gray shading provided by Tableau when dragging elements, such as worksheets and containers, onto a dashboard helpfully communicates where the <a/>elements will be placed. Take your time and observe carefully when placing an element on a dashboard or the results may be unexpected.</p></li>&#13;
    </ol><ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="6">Note the <strong class="keyWord">Floating</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Tiled</strong> buttons at the bottom left, next to your dashboard, as well as under the handle dropdown. If you select <strong class="keyWord">Floating</strong> instead of <strong class="keyWord">Tiled</strong>, your worksheets will not auto-adjust anymore and will be “floating” around the dashboard instead. This is a free form of worksheet arrangement on a dashboard, which is a powerful functionality, especially combined with transparent backgrounds. Note that floating can also be achieved by selecting it from the <strong class="keyWord">More Options</strong> dropdown on the right-hand side of every sheet in the dashboard:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_20.png" alt="Graphical user interface&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with low confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.20: Tiled and Floating</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="7">Now, you can format the<a/> dashboard as desired. The following tips may prove helpful:<ul><li class="bulletList">Adjust the sizes of the elements on the screen by hovering over the edges between each element and then clicking and dragging. Drag the edges of containers to adjust the size of each worksheet.</li>&#13;
          <li class="bulletList">Make an element floating, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.18</em>.</li>&#13;
          <li class="bulletList">Create horizontal and vertical containers by dragging <strong class="keyWord">Horizontal</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Vertical</strong> from the <strong class="keyWord">Objects</strong> pane onto the dashboard. Other objects, such as <strong class="keyWord">Text</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Image</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">Blank</strong>, can be added to containers too.</li>&#13;
          <li class="bulletList">Display the dashboard title by selecting <strong class="keyWord">Dashboard </strong>in the top pane, then <strong class="keyWord">Show Title</strong>. Double-click the title itself to adjust: </li>&#13;
        </ul><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_21.png" alt="A picture containing timeline&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.21: The Olympics dashboard</p>&#13;
      </li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">As you can see, you have just created your first dashboard. All worksheets are in place now. In the next part, we will <a/>add filter functionality to make the dashboard more interactive and meaningful.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Adding interactivity to a dashboard</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">One of the primary benefits of Tableau is<a/> the interactivity it provides for the end user. Dashboards aren’t simply for viewing; they’re meant for interaction. In this exercise, we’ll add interactivity to the dashboard that was created in the previous exercise:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="keyWord">Medals</strong> sheet on the dashboard and click on the drop-down arrow on the right-hand side, which will open a menu as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.22</em>.

    <p class="normal">To conclude, you have learned how to put existing worksheets, as tiled or floating objects, on a dashboard. You have changed the dashboard layout by dragging and dropping, as well as by using containers, filters, and action filters. Each of these core activities will be repeated multiple times throughout the book, so feel free to come back to this chapter and repeat the exercise steps whenever needed!</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Next, you will learn<a/> how to connect your own data to Tableau and work with it.</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Connecting Tableau to your data</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">At the time of writing, Tableau’s <a/>data connection menu includes more than 90 different connection types. And that’s somewhat of an understatement since some of those types contain multiple options. For example, <strong class="keyWord">Other Files</strong> includes more than 30 options. Of course, we won’t cover the details for every connection type, but we will cover the basics. The official documentation on all connectors can be found here: <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/exampleconnections_overview.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/exampleconnections_overview.htm</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Upon opening a new instance of Tableau Desktop from within Tableau Desktop (<strong class="keyWord">File </strong>| <strong class="keyWord">New</strong>), you’ll notice a <strong class="keyWord">Connect to Data</strong> link in the top-left corner of the workspace. Clicking on that link will enable you to connect to the data. Opening a new instance of Tableau from the application’s location on your computer will bring up the blue <strong class="keyWord">Connect </strong>pane right away. Alternatively, you can click on the <strong class="keyWord">New Data Source</strong> icon on the toolbar.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Although in future chapters we’ll connect to other data sources, here we’ll limit the discussion to connecting to Microsoft Excel and text files.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Connecting to a file</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s see how you can connect <a/>to a file, using Excel as an example:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">In Tableau, navigate to <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">New Data Source</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Excel</strong> to connect to the <code class="inlineCode">Sample - Superstore</code> dataset that is installed with Tableau Desktop (it should be located on your hard drive under <strong class="keyWord">My Tableau Repository</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Data sources</strong>).</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Double-click on the <strong class="keyWord">Orders</strong> sheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="keyWord">New Worksheet</strong> tab, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.27</em>:</li>&#13;

      <li class="numberedList">Place <strong class="keyWord">Discount</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Text</strong> shelf in the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Double-click on <strong class="keyWord">Profit</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Sales</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_28.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.28: First worksheet</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You’ve just created your first worksheet!</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you want to <a/>connect to a <code class="inlineCode">.csv</code> file, you could use the <strong class="keyWord">Text file</strong> option. Later in this book, in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Leveraging Advanced Analytics</em>, we will also connect to spatial files.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this section, we learned how to connect to files. We’ll continue with another important connection type in the next section: Tableau Server.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Connecting to Tableau Server</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Connecting to Tableau Server is perhaps the single most important server connection type to consider, since it’s frequently used to provide a better level of performance than may otherwise be <a/>possible. Additionally, connecting to Tableau Server enables the author to receive not only data but also information regarding how that data is to be interpreted—for example, whether a given field should be considered a measure or a dimension. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We’ll discuss the difference between these terms in the <em class="italic">Dimensions and measures</em> section later in the chapter.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The following are the steps for connecting to Tableau Server:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">To complete this exercise, access to an instance of Tableau Server is necessary. If you don’t have access to Tableau Server, consider installing a trial version on your local computer.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the workbook <a/>associated with this chapter, navigate to the <strong class="keyWord">Connecting to Tableau Server</strong> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Right-click on the <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> data source and select <strong class="keyWord">Publish to Server…</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_29.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.29: Publish to Server…</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="4">Log in to <strong class="keyWord">Tableau Server</strong> and follow the prompts to complete the publication of the data source.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Open a new instance of Tableau Desktop, select <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">New Data Source</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Tableau Server</strong>, and then search for the <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> dataset you just published<strong class="keyWord"> </strong>and connect.</li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">Having completed the preceding two exercises, let’s discuss the most germane point, that is, <strong class="keyWord">metadata</strong>. Metadata is often defined as <em class="italic">data about data</em>. In the preceding case, the data source name, default aggregation, and default number formatting are all examples of consistency across multiple authors. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you were to change a field name, for example, and then publish the data source to Tableau Server, the new field name would remain since Tableau remembers changes made to the metadata. This is important, for example, if your company has a policy regarding the use of decimal points when displaying currency; that policy will be easily adhered to if all Tableau authors start building workbooks by<a/> pointing to data sources where all formatting has been predefined.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Later on in this book, we will connect to other server types, like Google BigQuery, but the handling of all servers is pretty much the same and very straightforward. If you still have questions, you can always check out <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/exampleconnections_overview.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/exampleconnections_overview.htm</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now, our last missing piece regarding connections is saved data sources. Please follow along with this as well.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Connecting to saved data sources</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Connecting to a saved <a/>data source on a local machine is very similar to connecting to a data source published on Tableau Server. Metadata definitions associated with the local data source are preserved just as they are on Tableau Server. Of course, since the data source is local instead of remote, the publication process is different.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s explore the following steps to create a local data connection using an example:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">In the workbook associated with this chapter, navigate to the <strong class="keyWord">First Worksheet</strong> tab.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane, right-click on the <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> data source and select <strong class="keyWord">Add to Saved Data Sources</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Using the resulting dialog box, save the data source as <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> in <strong class="keyWord">My Tableau Repository</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Data sources</strong>, which is located on your hard drive.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="keyWord">Go to Start</strong> icon located in the top-left part of your screen and observe the newly saved data source:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_30.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.30: Saved Data Sources</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You can save a local data source that points to a published data source on Tableau Server. First, connect to <a/>a published data source on Tableau Server. Then, right-click on the data source in your workspace and choose <strong class="keyWord">Add to Saved Data Sources</strong>. Now you can connect to Tableau Server directly from your start page!</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now that we’ve learned how to connect to files, Tableau Server, and saved data sources, we will continue our journey and dive into more details regarding <strong class="keyWord">Measure Names</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Measure Values</strong>.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section id="ch01lvl1sec04">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Measure Names and Measure Values</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">I’ve observed the following scenario frequently: a new Tableau author creates a worksheet and drags a measure to the <strong class="keyWord">Text</strong> shelf. They drag the second measure to various places on the view and get results that seem entirely unpredictable. The experience is very frustrating for the author since it’s so easy to accomplish this in Microsoft Excel! The good news is that it’s also easy to accomplish this in Tableau. It just requires a different approach.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Measure Names</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Measure Values</strong> are <a/>generated fields in Tableau. They don’t <a/>exist in the underlying data, but they’re indispensable for creating many kinds of views. As may be guessed from its placement in the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane and its name, <strong class="keyWord">Measure Names</strong> is a dimension whose members are made up of the names of each measure in the underlying dataset. <strong class="keyWord">Measure Values</strong> contains the numbers or values of each measure in the dataset.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this section, we’ll watch what happens when these generated fields are used independently, then<a/> observe how they work elegantly together to create a view. Let’s explore this with an <a/>exercise:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">In the workbook associated with this chapter, navigate to the <strong class="keyWord">MeasureNames</strong>/<strong class="keyWord">Values</strong> and make sure that the <code class="inlineCode">Olympics</code> data source is selected.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Drag <strong class="keyWord">Measure Values</strong> to the <strong class="keyWord">Text</strong> shelf and observe the results, all four values are printed on top of each other:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_31.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.31: Measure Values</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="3">Clear the worksheet by clicking on the <strong class="keyWord">Clear Sheet</strong> icon on the toolbar:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_32.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.32: Clear Sheet</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="4">Now, drag <strong class="keyWord">Measure Names</strong> to the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf and observe that the view merely displays <strong class="keyWord">No Measure Values</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Drag <strong class="keyWord">Measure Values</strong> to<a/> the <strong class="keyWord">Text</strong> shelf. Note the list of measures and associated values, each of the four values is printed in the respective row:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_33.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.33: List of Measure Values</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Perhaps the relationship between <strong class="keyWord">Measure Names</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Measure Values</strong> is best explained by an analogy. Consider several pairs of socks and a partitioned sock drawer. <em class="italic">Step 2</em> is the equivalent of throwing the socks into a pile. The results are, well, disorganized. <em class="italic">Step 4</em> is the <a/>equivalent of an empty sock drawer with partitions. The partitions are all in place but where are the socks? <em class="italic">Step 5</em> is a partitioned drawer full of nicely organized socks. <code class="inlineCode">Measure Names</code> is like the sock drawer. <code class="inlineCode">Measure Values</code> is like the socks.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Independent of one another, they aren’t of much use. Used together, they can be applied in many different ways.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Measure Names and Measure Values shortcuts</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau provides various shortcuts to quickly create the desired visualization. If you’re new to the software, this shortcut<a/> behavior may not seem intuitive, but you’ll gain an understanding of it. Let’s use the following exercise to explore how you can use a <a/>shortcut to rapidly deploy <code class="inlineCode">Measure Names</code> and <code class="inlineCode">Measure Values</code>:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">In the workbook associated with this chapter, navigate to the <strong class="keyWord">MeasureNames</strong>/<strong class="keyWord">Values ShrtCts</strong> worksheet.</li>&#13;

      <li class="numberedList">Drag <strong class="keyWord"># Men</strong> directly on top of <strong class="keyWord"># Women</strong> in the view (<strong class="keyWord">Show Me</strong> appears):</li>&#13;

    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="4">Observe the results, including the appearance of the <strong class="keyWord">Measure Values</strong> shelf, the deployment of <strong class="keyWord">Measure Names</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Filters</strong> shelves, and <strong class="keyWord">Measure Values</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Text</strong> shelf:</li>&#13;

    <p class="normal">Several things happened in <em class="italic">step 2</em> of this<em class="italic"> </em>exercise. After placing the <code class="inlineCode"># Men</code> number on top of the <code class="inlineCode"># Women</code> number in <a/>the view, Tableau did the following:</p>&#13;

        </ul></li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Displayed the <strong class="keyWord">Measure Values</strong> shelf:<ul><li class="bulletList">The <code class="inlineCode">Measure Values</code> shelf is somewhat redundant.

You will come across those concepts more in <a/>your Tableau career, but now that you’ve successfully mastered the basics, let’s move on to three other concepts that will be beneficial for your learning curve.</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Three essential Tableau concepts</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">An important stop on the road to mastering Tableau involves three essential concepts. In this section, we’ll discuss each of them:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">Dimensions and measures</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Row-level, aggregate-level, and table-level calculations</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Continuous and discrete</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">We’ll start by defining <strong class="keyWord">dimensions</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">measures</strong>.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Dimensions and measures</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau categorizes every<a/> field from an underlying data source as either a <strong class="keyWord">dimension</strong> or a <strong class="keyWord">measure</strong>. A dimension is<a/> qualitative or, to use another word, categorical. A measure is quantitative or aggregable. A measure is<a/> usually a number but may be an aggregated, non-numeric field, such as <code class="inlineCode">MAX (Date)</code>. A dimension is usually a text, Boolean, or date field, but may also be a number, such as <code class="inlineCode">Number of Records</code>. Dimensions provide meaning to numbers by slicing those numbers into separate parts/categories. Measures without dimensions are mostly meaningless.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s look at an example to understand better:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">In the workbook associated with this chapter, navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Dimensions and Measures</code> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Drag <code class="inlineCode">Number of Records</code> to the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> on the <strong class="screenText">Marks</strong> Card. The result is mostly meaningless. The number of<strong class="keyWord"> </strong>measures is <strong class="screenText">15,316</strong>, but without the context supplied by slicing the measure across one or more dimensions, there is really no way to understand what it means:</li>&#13;

    <h2 class="heading-2">Row-level, aggregate-level, and table-level calculations</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">There are <a/>three levels <a/>of calculations in Tableau: <em class="italic">row</em>, <em class="italic">aggregate</em>, and <em class="italic">table</em>. To<a/> understand how<a/> these three levels function, it’s important to<a/> understand the Tableau processes. We’ll do so<a/> with an example that considers the <code class="inlineCode">Number of Records</code> and <code class="inlineCode">Quantity</code> fields from the <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> dataset.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Consider the following calculation types, calculated fields, and queries. A comparison to the commonly used language <a/>SQL will give us a better understanding of how to interpret Tableau calculations. Note that the SQL is slightly simplified for the sake<a/> of this example.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s take a deeper<a/> look at the three levels of calculations and consider the example in the following table:</p>&#13;

        </tr></tbody></table><p class="normal">For the row- and aggregate-level calculations, the computation is actually completed by the data source engine, as Tableau is an in-memory tool. Tableau merely displays the results. This, however, isn’t the case for the table-level calculation. Although the query passed to the data source for the table-level calculation is identical to the query for the aggregate-level calculation, Tableau performs additional computations on the returned results. Let’s explore this further with an exercise using the same calculated fields.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s look at the following steps and begin our exercise:</p>&#13;

Note that <a/>each must be created separately; that is, it isn’t possible in this context to create a single calculated field that<a/> contains all three calculations:<ul><li class="bulletList">Name the first calculation <code class="inlineCode">Lev – Row</code> and enter the following code: <code class="inlineCode">[Number of Records]/[Quantity]</code>.</li>&#13;

    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Lev - Agg</strong> is an aggregate-level calculation. The computation is completed by the data<a/> source engine. The sum of <code class="inlineCode">[Number of Records]</code> is divided by the sum of <code class="inlineCode">[Quantity]</code>. The results of the calculation are<a/> likely useful for the Tableau author.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Lev - Row</strong> is a row-level calculation. The computation is completed by the data source<a/> engine. <code class="inlineCode">[Number of Records]</code> is divided by <code class="inlineCode">[Quantity]</code> for each row of the underlying data. The results are then summed across all rows. Of course, in this case, the row-level calculation doesn’t provide useful results; however, since a new Tableau author may mistakenly create a row-level calculation when an aggregate-level calculation is what’s really needed, the example is included here.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Lev - Tab</strong> is a table calculation. Some of the computation is completed by the <a/>data source engine, that is, the aggregation. Tableau completes additional computation on the results returned from the data source engine based on the dimensions and level of detail in the data displayed in the sheet. Specifically, the results of <strong class="keyWord">Lev - Agg</strong> are summed <a/>and then divided by the number of members in the dimension. For the preceding example, this is:</li>&#13;

    <h2 class="heading-2">Continuous and discrete</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Continuous and <a/>discrete aren’t concepts that are unique<a/> to Tableau. Indeed, both can be observed in many arenas. Consider the <a/>following example:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_42.png" alt="A picture containing text, vector graphics&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.42: Continuous and discrete</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The preceding diagram is of two rivers: <em class="italic">River-Left</em> and <em class="italic">River-Right</em>. Water is flowing in River-Left. River-Right is composed of ice cubes. Could you theoretically sort the ice cubes in River-Right? Yes! Is <a/>there any way to sort the water in River-Left? In other words, could you take<a/> buckets of water from the bottom of the river, cart those buckets upstream and pour the water back into River-Left, and thereby say “I have sorted the water in the river?” No. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O in River-Left is in a continuous form, that is, water. The H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O in River-Right is in <a/>a discrete form, that is, ice.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Having considered continuous and discrete examples in nature, let’s turn our attention back to Tableau. Continuous and discrete in Tableau can be more clearly understood with the following seven considerations:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Continuous is green. Discrete is blue:<ul><li class="bulletList">Select any field in the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane or place any field on a shelf and you’ll note that it’s either green or blue. Also, the icons associated with fields are either green or blue.</li>&#13;
        </ul></li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Continuous is always <code class="inlineCode">numeric</code>. Discrete may be a <code class="inlineCode">string</code>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Continuous and discrete <a/>aren’t synonymous with dimensions and measures:<ul><li class="bulletList">It’s common for new Tableau authors to conflate continuous with measures<a/> and discrete with dimensions. They aren’t synonymous. A measure may be either discrete or continuous.</li>&#13;
          <li class="bulletList">Also, a dimension, if it’s a number, may be discrete or continuous. To prove this point, right-click on any numeric or date field in Tableau and note that you can convert it:</li>&#13;
        </ul><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_43.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.43: Converting between discrete and continuous</p>&#13;
      </li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Discrete values can be sorted. Continuous values can’t:<ul><li class="bulletList">Sortable/not sortable behavior is most easily observed with dates and a measure like <code class="inlineCode">Sum(Sales)</code>, as shown in the following example:</li>&#13;
        </ul><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_01_44.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.44: Left: continuous (not sortable). Right: discrete (sortable)</p>&#13;
      </li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Continuous colors are<a/> gradients. Discrete colors are distinct:<ul><li class="bulletList">The following example shows <strong class="keyWord">Sales</strong> as continuous and then as discrete. Note<a/> the difference in how colors are rendered. The left portion of the screenshot demonstrates the continuous results in gradients, and the right portion demonstrates the discrete results in distinctly colored categories:</li>&#13;

      </li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Continuous pills can be placed to the right of discrete pills, but not to the left because the discrete pills define the aggregation level:<ul><li class="bulletList">The Tableau author is able to place <strong class="keyWord">Region</strong> to the right of <strong class="keyWord">Year</strong> when <strong class="keyWord">Year</strong> is discrete.</li>&#13;
          <li class="bulletList">The Tableau<a/> author is unable to place <strong class="keyWord">Region</strong> to the right of <strong class="keyWord">Year</strong> when <strong class="keyWord">Year</strong> is continuous.</li>&#13;
        </ul></li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Continuous<a/> creates axes. Discrete creates headers:<ul><li class="bulletList">Note in the right portion of the following screenshot that <strong class="keyWord">Order Date</strong> is continuous and the <strong class="keyWord">Year of Order Date</strong> axis is selected. Since <strong class="keyWord">Year of Order Date</strong> is an axis, the entire <em class="italic">x</em>-plane is selected. In the left portion, however, <strong class="keyWord">Year(Order Date)</strong> is discrete and <strong class="keyWord">2014</strong> is selected. Since 2014 is a header only, it’s selected and not the entire <em class="italic">x</em>-plane:</li>&#13;
        </ul></li>&#13;

    <p class="normal">Congratulations, you just mastered three important concepts in Tableau: measures and dimensions, the level of calculations, and discrete and continuous values. With this knowledge alone, you will be able to create your first dashboards.

It will also help you to follow along in the upcoming chapters.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To conclude the basics, we will cover the export of dashboards to other devices next. Even if you don’t feel ready to do so yet, it will round up the basic Tableau Desktop tour and will provide the raw diamond as a whole.

<h1 class="heading-1">Summary</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we covered the basics of Tableau. We began with some basic terminology, then we looked at the basics of creating worksheets and dashboards. We focused on default behavior and how to override that behavior, and we considered some best practices. Then, we reviewed the fundamental principles of Measure Names and Measure Values. After that, we explored three essential Tableau concepts: dimensions and measures; row-, aggregate-, and table-level calculations; and the concepts of continuous and discrete. Of particular importance is understanding that row- and aggregate-level calculations are computed by the data source engine, while table-level calculations are handled by Tableau. Finally, we saw how to adjust your dashboard for other devices, such as a cellphone or tablet and Tableau Mobile in action.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we’ll continue our Tableau exploration by looking at data. We’ll consider how data is prepared using Tableau’s data handling engine, Hyper, and explore some useful data preparation models and techniques.</p>&#13;
