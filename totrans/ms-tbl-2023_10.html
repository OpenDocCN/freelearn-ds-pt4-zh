    <p class="normal">All Tableau authors are essentially storytellers. Analyzing data is more than just puzzle-solving; it is a search for a story that will make a difference. Topics can range from Airbnb to the Zika virus, and may be pleasantly diverting or life-changing, but they all serve a common need: to tell a story. This chapter is dedicated to helping you stock your toolkit of knowledge with ideas and methods for using Tableau to make presentations that engage, delight, and make a difference.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This chapter will explore the following presentation-centric topics:</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Getting the best images out of Tableau</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will review <a/>options for exporting an image from Tableau into other applications and discuss the pros and cons of each method. We’ll begin by surveying various screenshot applications and then we will consider methods that are available directly in Tableau.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Perhaps the easiest way to capture an image in Tableau is to use a screen capture tool. The following are some screen capture tools that won’t impact your pocketbook:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Grab</strong> is a screen capture utility natively available on macOS. Grab is located in the <strong class="keyWord">Utilities</strong> folder <a/>under <strong class="keyWord">Applications</strong>. You can also access it via the following shortcuts: <em class="keystroke">Shift</em> + <em class="keystroke">Command</em> + <em class="keystroke">3</em> for a screenshot, <em class="keystroke">Shift</em> + <em class="keystroke">Command</em> + <em class="keystroke">4</em> for a partial screenshot, and <em class="keystroke">Shift</em> + <em class="keystroke">Command</em> + <em class="keystroke">5</em> for a timer screenshot.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Snipping Tool</strong> is installed <a/>by default with Windows, a very simple tool with few bells and whistles, easy to use and effective.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Greenshot</strong> is an open-source <a/>screen capture tool with many features. Visit <a href="http://getgreenshot.org/" target="_blank"><span class="url">http://getgreenshot.org/</span></a> to download the application and learn more.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Microsoft Office OneNote</strong> includes <a/>a screen capture feature. If you have OneNote installed, simply press <em class="keystroke">Windows</em> + <em class="keystroke">S</em> to activate the screen capture or else press <em class="keystroke">Windows</em> + <em class="keystroke">N</em> and then the <em class="keystroke">S</em> key for activation.<div class="note">&#13;
          <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">General rule of thumb</strong>: Capture a screenshot bigger than is needed because capturing more pixels will increase the quality. You can then decrease the size and make it fit for purpose, keeping more pixels on a smaller surface. (For very small objects, increase the scale of your computer display temporarily to get more pixels per square centimeter.)</p>&#13;
        </div>&#13;
      </li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Now that we have <a/>covered the tools for image capturing, let us have a look into the native capabilities that ship with Tableau.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Tableau’s native export capabilities</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">One of the shortcomings of screen <a/>capture tools is that they are limited to <strong class="keyWord">raster images</strong>. Raster images are often sufficient for documentation or a PowerPoint presentation but <a/>are subject to pixelation if enlarged. Vector images, on the other hand, do not pixelate when enlarged and may therefore provide sharper image quality. Natively, Tableau includes both raster and vector export options. These options are discussed in the following list.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau can export images in three formats, accessible via <strong class="keyWord">Worksheet</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Export</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Image</strong>:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">SVG</strong> is the only vector<a/> image offered in Tableau at the time of writing. Use this format to avoid pixelation if enlarged. If your image has lots of fine details and textures, SVGs are at a disadvantage because they are based on points <a/>and paths rather than single pixels.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">JPEG</strong> is a raster image format that is good for high-resolution images such as photographs, but does <a/>not work very well for low-color images, such as those typically deployed in Tableau. Export an image from Tableau in JPEG format and then zoom in close. Note that the white space (especially white space surrounding text) includes stray pixels of various colors. These are known as <strong class="keyWord">artifacts</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">noise</strong>. Although these pixels are not visible unless zoomed in, the overall impact on an exported image is that it can look blurry. Thus, there is rarely, if ever, a reason to export to JPEG from Tableau.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Like JPEG images, <strong class="keyWord">PNG</strong> images are raster. The advantage of the PNG format is that it works well with <a/>both high-color images such as photographs and low-color images like those typically used in Tableau. Export an image from Tableau in PNG format and zoom in to observe that, although pixelation occurs, the white space comprises only white. Unlike JPEG images, no artifacts or noise appear. PNG should be considered the format of choice when using a raster image.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">BMP</strong> is a raster image format <a/>that looks quite nice but is uncompressed and can thus result in large image files. Today, the BMP format is considered antiquated and should typically be avoided.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">I suggest you try all four <a/>of them. Luckily, Tableau also provides us with a native feature to export to a PDF as a vector image, as well as exporting to PowerPoint directly. In the next section, we will take a look at the PowerPoint export feature and some variations to it.</p>&#13;

<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">From Tableau to PowerPoint</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">PowerPoint</strong> is ubiquitous. Some may argue that other presentation tools such as Prezi are superior, but for many <a/>organizations (probably the vast majority) PowerPoint remains the software of choice.</p>&#13;
    <div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">Prezi is a tool that can be accessed via the web. Typically, you won’t see classical slides but an <a/>interactive, moving presentation. Templates are available online <a/>and they offer free as well as paid tiers. You can check it out here: <a href="http://www.prezi.com" target="_blank"><span class="url">www.prezi.com</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <p class="normal">As such, it’s important to integrate Tableau and PowerPoint efficiently and effectively. It is possible to export your dashboard directly into PowerPoint. You will find the option under <strong class="screenText">File</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Export As PowerPoint…</strong>:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_10_01.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.1: Export As PowerPoint…</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">After making this <a/>selection, you will be asked whether you want to export the current view or a selection of sheets from the workbook:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_10_02.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.2: Export PowerPoint</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Try both options to see how the native Tableau export functionality appears in PowerPoint. If you want to put in a little extra effort, there are options to create a PowerPoint implementation of Tableau via a different route. These alternatives might present added value <a/>for you. The following exercises explore the various techniques for doing so and the added value they offer.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Creating a template</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">For this first PowerPoint-centric exercise, you will create a template that will be utilized in future exercises. It will <a/>include common PowerPoint elements such as a header and a footer. The size of the template will be 1200 x 900, which adheres to the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used for PowerPoint presentations. Of course, if your company is using another aspect ratio, you can always adjust! Let’s look at the following steps:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">For every screenshot you will take now, you will always have the same design surrounding it. By doing <a/>so, your presentations will look more appealing, and your audience will soon recognize your work by its design. A template such as this can also help you follow company design guidelines. As an extra tip, make sure that you use matching colors for headers, footers, and your graphs!</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Next, we will go through some examples to see the template in use.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Creating a dashboard for print</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This exercise will utilize the template created previously and incorporate a dashboard, which will then be <a/>suitable for printing and/or presenting. Basic instructions are provided, but specifics are left to individual preference:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Right-click on the tab entitled <code class="inlineCode">Template</code> created in the previous exercise, <em class="italic">Creating a template</em>, and select <strong class="keyWord">Duplicate</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Rename the duplicate dashboard <code class="inlineCode">Superstore Loss Leaders</code>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Populate the <strong class="keyWord">Superstore Loss Leaders</strong> dashboard with the worksheets <code class="inlineCode">HexMap</code> and <code class="inlineCode">Loss Leaders States</code>. (These are two worksheets I put together based on the <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> dataset, showing the <strong class="keyWord">Profit Ratio</strong> on a hex map as well as a list with the <strong class="keyWord">Bottom 20 Profit States </strong>to identify where more work needs to be done.) Arrange as desired. An example layout is given as follows:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_10_17.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.17: Dashboard and template</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The dashboard on top of the template looks great, doesn’t it? It immediately looks more interesting and presentation worthy. But are you asking, why did we choose to work with that specific layout? Well, let me elaborate: if you want to show a Tableau dashboard in a printed version or you have to export the dashboard into PowerPoint, it is important to <a/>remember that all interactivity will be lost. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">One of the highlights and biggest selling points of Tableau—interactivity—doesn’t work on a 2D print. But obviously, you don’t want to recreate graphs that already exist in some form on your Tableau Server, and you don’t have to. Just make sure that your audience understands the visualization without being able to click on a field or hover over to show more info:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tip 1</strong>: The dashboard in <em class="italic">Figure 10.17</em> has been adjusted to the colors of the template to make it appear as if the two belong together.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tip 2</strong>: A <strong class="keyWord">hexagon map</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">hex map</strong>) has been used instead of the default map that comes with Tableau. The <a/>reason is that smaller states on the east coast disappear when printed in the actual ratio and Alaska and Hawaii are so far away that they usually don’t fit on the map either. A hex map gives the same space to each state and hence, even if printed, the user can see what’s going on in Alaska as well as in Rhode Island.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tip 3</strong>: The colors indicate that the profit ratio is especially bad in Ohio and Colorado, but your audience might want to know more. That’s when the table comes into play. The profit ratio is profit divided by sales and the table shows both numbers so that the audience can get a better picture of the current situation and you can avoid them asking.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tip 4</strong>: In order to avoid a printed scroll-down bar, I selected the bottom 20 states only. If the topic is loss leaders, it is not very likely that you will need to show all the states that do well.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">I hope this example gave you some ideas on how to prepare your dashboard for printing! If printing happens more frequently, I advise you to add it as a page to your interactive dashboard on <a/>Tableau Server such that you always have it ready to go if asked for. If you are interested in replicating the hex map, check <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Going Beyond the Basics</em>, or go ahead and check out the following article: <a href="https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/1/viz-whiz-hex-tile-maps-64713" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/1/viz-whiz-hex-tile-maps-64713</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Next, we will look at another example, this time an automation for a weekly PowerPoint presentation.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Semi-automating a PowerPoint presentation</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The previous exercises (<em class="italic">Creating a template </em>and<em class="italic"> Creating a dashboard for print</em>) demonstrated <a/>two methods for generating a template for a PowerPoint presentation and gave you some tips on how to adjust your dashboard for printing and/or PowerPoint presentations. Usually, however, your Tableau dashboard isn’t static, and the data will change by the next time you need it. You can, of course, export a new PowerPoint file with the updated data, but you might have other slides as well that you don’t want to lose. The following steps will help you with a semi-automated way of updating your PowerPoint presentation:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the dashboard created previously entitled <code class="inlineCode">Superstore Loss Leaders</code>.</li>&#13;

Although Tableau Desktop only allows the author to update one image at a time, Tableau Server can be configured to export multiple images simultaneously, thereby making the process even more efficient. Exporting images from Tableau Server is discussed in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud</em>.</p>&#13;

<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">It is possible to embed Tableau directly into a PowerPoint presentation or, to be more accurate, it’s possible <a/>to embed a web browser through <a/>which an instance of Tableau Server may be accessed. There are various methods for accomplishing this, including the Web Viewer app, a third-party add-in called LiveWeb, and VBA code.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The Web Viewer app is <a/>available at <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104295828?tab=Overview" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104295828?tab=Overview</span></a>. Although it works well for Tableau Public, the default Tableau Server settings disallow access via Web Viewer. Your Tableau Server Admin will be able to help change the <a/>settings though. LiveWeb (available at <a href="http://skp.mvps.org/liveweb.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">http://skp.mvps.org/liveweb.htm</span></a>) works well but requires an additional installation. You must download the installation from the URL provided and start PowerPoint. You will then be able to add another add-in to your PowerPoint ribbon, which, in return, allows you to add a Tableau Server URL that will be displayed directly in Tableau. Detailed instructions can be found on the website too.</p>&#13;

<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Google Slides is <a/>another widely used presentation tool <a/>and, due to its web-based nature, a convenient one. Just like in PowerPoint, you can insert images, audio, and video but unfortunately no web page or a Tableau dashboard.</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">In this section, you have <a/>learned how you can embed Google Slides into <a/>a Tableau dashboard and hence use one tool instead of switching between two. Next, we will discuss ways to bring animation to Tableau that can support your data storytelling.</p>&#13;

<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Animating Tableau</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Including animation in a presentation can be very effective for engaging an audience. Hans Rosling accomplishes this admirably with his popular YouTube video <em class="italic">200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes </em>(<a href="https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo</span></a>). In this video, Rosling uses data visualization to track <a/>wealth and life expectancy over time. His combination of data visualization with insightful commentary and a passion for his message makes Rosling’s video a must-see for anyone interested in making appealing presentations using data.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Animations are easy to implement and are available via Tableau Reader as well as Tableau Server (since the 2020.1 release). At the time of writing, I have only encountered one drawback; worksheets with animations that are uploaded to Tableau Server will provide a single-speed level, whereas Tableau Desktop will show three. Regardless, that should not stop you from using this functionality.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The following exercise tracks ACT testing scores from 1991 to 2015. Complete the exercise to learn how to create an animation in Tableau and discover whether standardized testing results in the United States have improved over time.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Perform the following steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the workbook associated with this chapter and navigate to the worksheet entitled <code class="inlineCode">ACT 1991–2015</code>.</li>&#13;

      <li class="numberedList">Rename the sheet <code class="inlineCode">ACT scores</code>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Place <strong class="keyWord">Year</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Columns</strong> shelf, <strong class="keyWord">Score Value</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf, and <strong class="keyWord">Score Type</strong> on <strong class="keyWord">Color</strong> in the <strong class="keyWord">Marks</strong> card.</li>&#13;

    <p class="normal">Even though this functionality is not a good use case for thorough analytics, it does help when visualizing change <a/>over time, for example, while giving a presentation or for any other kind of storytelling. I most recently used it to show how product clusters changed over time, with the conclusion that clusters should not remain static. I then continued to search for early identification of such change in clusters in order to adjust pricing and marketing accordingly.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To conclude, animations are <a/>possible in Tableau using a functionality called <strong class="keyWord">Pages</strong>. I hope you will find many use cases for this feature. Next, we will use the animation features in a different way, by showing you how to export multiple images with it.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Using an animation to export many images</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">There are at least two <a/>reasons why it may be necessary to export many images from a timeline. First, it may be analytically advantageous to see separate images for each time snapshot; for example, a separate image for each day in a month. Second, it may be necessary to create an animation outside of Tableau, perhaps in PowerPoint.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The next two exercises <em class="italic">Using an animation to export many images</em> and <em class="italic">Using an animation in Tableau to create an animation in PowerPoint</em> cover both scenarios:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">By following all the <a/>preceding steps, you should have been able to save multiple images at once. This is hopefully a time-saver for you, and even though it might not happen too often, it will benefit you to know about this option.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Using an animation in Tableau to create an animation in PowerPoint</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This exercise <a/>will show you how <a/>to create an animation from the mass of images we saved in the preceding exercise. Hence, we will use the files created previously to animate in PowerPoint:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Access the PowerPoint presentation downloaded from <a href="https://www.pdftoppt.com/" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.pdftoppt.com/</span></a> in the previous exercise.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="keyWord">View</strong> ribbon, select <strong class="keyWord">Slide Sorter </strong>under the <strong class="keyWord">Presentation Views </strong>group.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="keyWord">all slides</strong> in the PowerPoint presentation except for the last one.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">On the <strong class="keyWord">Transition</strong> ribbon under the <strong class="keyWord">Timing </strong>group, set to advance the slide after 0.1 seconds:</li>&#13;

    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="5">Press <em class="keystroke">F5</em> to see the animation.</li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">Isn’t this cool? You can see a similar simulation to what you would see in Tableau using Pages! To further improve the animation in PowerPoint, consider the following additional steps:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">Upload the initial PDF to <a href="https://pdfresizer.com/crop" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://pdfresizer.com/crop</span></a> and crop the size as desired.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">If the animation is too slow in PowerPoint, it is likely that all the text and drawing elements are maintained. For example, the background grid is made up of individual lines. Rendering all text and drawing elements is resource-intensive. Consider creating a separate PowerPoint presentation using the PNG images created in the <em class="italic">Using an animation to export many images </em>exercise. This will lead to a quicker, smoother-running animation.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">I hope that this <a/>section has given you some <a/>ideas on how you can improve and impress with PowerPoint. Using these newly acquired techniques, you might not even need Prezi after all. However, this chapter wouldn’t be complete without mentioning story points, a feature that will bring you a long way if you don’t want to use PowerPoint at all.</p>&#13;

        </tr></tbody></table><p class="normal">The basics of creating and using story points are straightforward, and also, at the time of writing, there is not much beyond the basics. Since the focus of this book is on more advanced Tableau ideas <a/>and concepts, those basics will not be considered here. If you need to quickly understand story point basics, I recommend reading through the following pages: <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/stories.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/stories.htm</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">I like story points and I like to use them especially when my audience has its own version of Tableau open in front of them and can follow along with their own actions. It is a great way to give people a deeper understanding because it allows you to show more complexity than a static screenshot. If you are looking to improve your presentation skills in general, continue reading the next section.</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">Using story points effectively <a/>in Tableau is perhaps more of an artistic consideration than a technical one. Although this book attempts to consistently consider best practices for data visualization and to encourage attractive and user-friendly worksheets and dashboards, a discussion of effective presentation techniques is beyond its scope.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you would like to improve <a/>your ability to create effective presentations, consider the following resources:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tableau story points</strong>: Learning by example is invaluable. Fine examples of story points can be found on Tableau. To learn from one of the most engaging, navigate to <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/story_example.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/story_example.htm</span></a>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">TEDx talks</strong>: TEDx talks are great for learning and can even be listened to while commuting or being away from your desk in general. One video I would recommend is The 3 Magic Ingredients of Amazing Presentations by Phil Waknell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD8RMq2OkU" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD8RMq2OkU</span></a>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Blogs</strong>: One of the more interesting posts discussing Tableau story points in combination with good <a/>presentation methodology can be found here: <a href="https://www.artofvisualization.com/blog/10-secrets-perfect-tableau-story" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.artofvisualization.com/blog/10-secrets-perfect-tableau-story</span></a>.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Even though these presentation skills are beyond the scope of this chapter, I do hope that the preceding resources have given you food for thought.</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">We began this chapter by exploring various screen capture tools as well as Tableau’s native export capabilities. Next, we turned our consideration to PowerPoint, where we explored various methods for creating PowerPoint presentations from Tableau workbooks, and even explored how to embed a live instance of Tableau into PowerPoint. Next, we considered Tableau animation. Lastly, we explored how to use story points and dashboards for presentations. In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Designing Dashboards and Best Practices for Visualizations</em>, we will turn our attention to dashboarding, where we will push beyond the normal boundaries of the typical dashboard, but not lose focus of the practical applications.</p>&#13;
