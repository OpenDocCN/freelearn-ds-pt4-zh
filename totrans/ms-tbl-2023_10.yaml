- en: One of the shortcomings of screen capture tools is that they are limited to
    **raster images**. Raster images are often sufficient for documentation or a PowerPoint
    presentation but are subject to pixelation if enlarged. Vector images, on the
    other hand, do not pixelate when enlarged and may therefore provide sharper image
    quality. Natively, Tableau includes both raster and vector export options. These
    options are discussed in the following list.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Tableau can export images in three formats, accessible via **Worksheet** |
    **Export** | **Image**:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**SVG** is the only vector image offered in Tableau at the time of writing.
    Use this format to avoid pixelation if enlarged. If your image has lots of fine
    details and textures, SVGs are at a disadvantage because they are based on points
    and paths rather than single pixels.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**JPEG** is a raster image format that is good for high-resolution images such
    as photographs, but does not work very well for low-color images, such as those
    typically deployed in Tableau. Export an image from Tableau in JPEG format and
    then zoom in close. Note that the white space (especially white space surrounding
    text) includes stray pixels of various colors. These are known as **artifacts**
    or **noise**. Although these pixels are not visible unless zoomed in, the overall
    impact on an exported image is that it can look blurry. Thus, there is rarely,
    if ever, a reason to export to JPEG from Tableau.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like JPEG images, **PNG** images are raster. The advantage of the PNG format
    is that it works well with both high-color images such as photographs and low-color
    images like those typically used in Tableau. Export an image from Tableau in PNG
    format and zoom in to observe that, although pixelation occurs, the white space
    comprises only white. Unlike JPEG images, no artifacts or noise appear. PNG should
    be considered the format of choice when using a raster image.

    can make that process much quicker. Although Tableau Desktop only allows the author
    to update one image at a time, Tableau Server can be configured to export multiple
    images simultaneously, thereby making the process even more efficient. Exporting
    images from Tableau Server is discussed in *Chapter 14*, *Exploring Tableau Server

    to be more accurate, it’s possible to embed a web browser through which an instance
    of Tableau Server may be accessed. There are various methods for accomplishing
    this, including the Web Viewer app, a third-party add-in called LiveWeb, and VBA
    code.

    Although it works well for Tableau Public, the default Tableau Server settings
    disallow access via Web Viewer. Your Tableau Server Admin will be able to help
    change the settings though. LiveWeb (available at [http://skp.mvps.org/liveweb.htm](http://skp.mvps.org/liveweb.htm))
    works well but requires an additional installation. You must download the installation
    from the URL provided and start PowerPoint. You will then be able to add another
    add-in to your PowerPoint ribbon, which, in return, allows you to add a Tableau
    Server URL that will be displayed directly in Tableau. Detailed instructions can
    be found on the website too.
