<h1 class="chapterTitle">Designing Dashboards and Best Practices for Visualizations</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now, we will delve into the essential principles and best practices of data visualization, focusing specifically on dashboard design. By exploring how to present data in a visually compelling and informative manner, you will gain the knowledge and learn techniques that will help to create impactful dashboards to effectively communicate insights, drive decision-making, and engage your audience. This chapter was influenced by some giants in data visualization: <em class="italic">The Functional Art</em> by Alberto Cairo, <em class="italic">Information Dashboard Design</em> by Stephen Few, <em class="italic">The Big Book of Dashboards</em> by Steve Wexley, Jeffrey Shaffer, and Andy Cotgraeve, <em class="italic">Universal Principles of Design</em> by William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, and Jill Butler, <em class="italic">Data Story</em> by Nancy Duarte, and <em class="italic">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em> by Edward Tufte.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">Visualization design theory</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Formatting rules</li>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Visualization design theory</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Your <a/>visualization thought process should always begin with the basics of design from the lowest level. In other words, we will start talking about the worksheets displayed on dashboards and ensure that those worksheets are well designed. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Therefore, our discussion will begin with a consideration of visualization design principles, such as the<a/> following collection, which is inspired by the <em class="italic">7 principles of design</em>: <a href="https://www.turing.com/kb/what-are-the-7-principles-of-design-detailed-breakdown" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.turing.com/kb/what-are-the-7-principles-of-design-detailed-breakdown</span></a>:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Emphasize</strong> what is most important</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Amplify</strong> important data points</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Align and balance</strong> elements with appropriate use of color, size, and texture</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use <strong class="keyWord">contrast</strong> to highlight elements or groups</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Limit</strong> the use of colors or fonts to three to increase brand identity and keep control </li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use human-user friendly <strong class="keyWord">proportions</strong>, like the golden cut</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Keep the user’s eye <strong class="keyWord">moving</strong> in a Z line</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use <strong class="keyWord">lines</strong> for benchmarks or thresholds </li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use <strong class="keyWord">white space</strong> to <a/>organize and structure</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Thus, in the next section, <em class="italic">Formatting rules</em>, we will consider various rules, while keeping in mind that once you’re comfortable with the basics, rules can be broken to serve a purpose.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;

<section id="ch11lvl1sec69">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Formatting rules</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">The following formatting rules<a/> encompass <strong class="keyWord">fonts</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">lines</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">bands</strong>. Fonts are, of<a/> course, an obvious formatting consideration. Lines and bands, however, may<a/> not be something you typically work with—but in Tableau, lines<a/> and bands should certainly be considered. This illustrates that data visualization is closely related to graphic design, where lines and bands play a much bigger role than they do in, for example, Excel, and that formatting considers much more than just the textual layout.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Keep the font choice simple</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Typically, using<a/> one or two fonts on a dashboard is advisable. More fonts can create a confusing environment and interfere with readability.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Fonts chosen for titles should be thick and solid, while body fonts should be easy to read. In Tableau, choosing appropriate fonts is simple: select <strong class="keyWord">Format</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Font</strong> to display the <strong class="keyWord">Format Font</strong> window to see and choose the fonts you like. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The Tableau fonts always work, like Tableau Bold, Tableau Book, Tableau Medium, Tableau Light, and so on. And for a special occasion, I like to use Corbel or play around with new fonts.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Use lines in order of visibility</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We tend <a/>to order<a/> line visibility in the following order: trend line, chart line, reference line, drop line, and grid line. For example, trend-line visibility should be greater than reference-line visibility. Visibility is usually enhanced by increasing the line thickness but may be enhanced via color saturation or by choosing a dotted or dashed line over a solid line. Let’s look at each of the line types, in order of decreasing visibility:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Trend lines</strong>: The <a/>trend line, if present, is usually the most visible line on the graph. Trend lines are<a/> displayed via the <strong class="keyWord">Analytics</strong> pane and can be adjusted via <strong class="keyWord">Format</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Lines</strong>:<ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Use case</strong>: A time series with many data points and lots of fluctuation over time. Use a trend line to show an overall direction (increase/decrease over time) and thus make it easier for your users to process the information.</li>&#13;
        </ul></li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Chart lines</strong>: The chart line (for example, the line used on a time series chart) should not be so heavy <a/>as to obscure twists and turns in the data. Although a <a/>chart line may be displayed as dotted or dashed by utilizing the <strong class="keyWord">Pages</strong> shelf, this is usually not advisable because it may obscure visibility. The thickness of a chart line can be adjusted by clicking on the <strong class="keyWord">Size</strong> shelf in the <strong class="keyWord">Marks remove bold</strong> area:<ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Use case</strong>: This is the actual line of a line chart.</li>&#13;
        </ul></li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Reference lines</strong>: Usually less<a/> prevalent than trend lines and can be formatted <a/>via <strong class="keyWord">Format</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Reference lines</strong>:<ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Use case</strong>: A straight line to show, e.g., a threshold that is static for at least one dimension within the view of your dashboard.</li>&#13;
        </ul></li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Drop lines</strong>: Not frequently<a/> used. To deploy drop lines, right-click in a blank <a/>portion of your <strong class="keyWord">view</strong> and select <strong class="keyWord">Drop lines</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Show drop lines</strong>. Next, click a point in the view to display a drop line. To format drop lines, select <strong class="keyWord">Format</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Drop Lines</strong>. Drop lines are relevant only if at least one axis is utilized in the visualization:<ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Use case</strong>: To mark the line from a point on your chart to the axis. It can help you to identify the specific value associated with that data point.</li>&#13;
        </ul></li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Zero lines</strong>: These are sometimes referred to as baselines, and only display if zero<a/> or negative values are included in the view, or positive numerical <a/>values are relatively close to zero. Format zero lines via <strong class="keyWord">Format</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Lines</strong>:<ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Use case</strong>: If you aren’t happy with the default zero line, you can format it. It can help distinguish where positive values start and negative ones end (and vice versa).</li>&#13;
        </ul></li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Grid lines</strong>: These should be the most muted <a/>lines on the view and may be dispensed with altogether. Format grid lines<a/> via <strong class="keyWord">Format</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Lines</strong>:<ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Use case</strong>: Grid lines help the eye to identify values of data points that are otherwise far away from the axis. Use them to help users to better understand values in your visualization.</li>&#13;
        </ul></li>&#13;
    </ul><h2 class="heading-2">Use bands in groups of three to five</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Visualizations <a/>composed of a tall table of text or horizontal bars should segment dimension members <a/>into groups of three to five.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Please follow along with the steps to experience an efficient use of bands in Tableau:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Navigate to <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/marleen.meier" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://public.tableau.com/profile/marleen.meier</span></a> to locate and download the workbook associated with this chapter.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Banding</code> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select the <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> data source and place <strong class="keyWord">Product Name</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Double-click on <strong class="keyWord">Discount</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Profit</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Quantity</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">Sales</strong>. Note that after completing this step, Tableau defaults to banding every other row. This default formatting is fine for a short table but is quite busy for a tall table, and it may lead to performance issues with large datasets.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Navigate to <strong class="screenText">Format</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Shading</strong> and set <strong class="screenText">Band Size</strong> under <strong class="screenText">Row Banding</strong> so that three to<a/> five lines of text are encompassed by each band. Be sure to set an appropriate <a/>color for both <strong class="screenText">Pane</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Header</strong>:</li>&#13;

    <p class="normal">The <em class="italic">Band in Groups of Three to Five</em> rule is <a/>influenced by Dona W. Wong, who, in her book <em class="italic">The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics</em>, recommends separating long tables or bar charts with thin lines to separate the bars into groups of three to five to help readers<a/> read across.</p>&#13;

<section id="ch11lvl1sec70">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Color rules</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">It seems slightly ironic to discuss color rules<a/> in a book that will be printed in black and white (to download the color images, look here: <a href="https://packt.link/TybKH" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://packt.link/TybKH</span></a>. Of course, that may not be true if you are reading this book on an electronic device). Nevertheless, even in a monochromatic setting, a discussion of color is relevant. For example, the exclusive use of black text communicates something different compared to using variations of gray. The following list of color rules should be helpful to ensure that you use colors effectively in a variety of settings.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Keep colors simple and limited</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Stick to the basic hues and provide only a few (perhaps three to five) hue variations. In his book <em class="italic">The Functional Art: An Introduction to Information Graphics and Visualization</em>, Alberto Cairo provides insight as to why this is important:</p>&#13;
    <blockquote class="packt_quote">&#13;
      <p class="quote">The limited capacity of our visual working memory helps explain why it’s not advisable to use more than four or five colors or pictograms to identify different phenomena on maps and charts.</p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Respect the psychological implications of colors</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">There is a color vocabulary in every region of the world so pervasive that it’s second nature. Red is often used for love or danger; in some Asian countries, it can also mean fortune and is common for wedding dresses. Green can mean luck, whereas in Mexico, green represents independence. Green traffic signals tell us to go, and red to stop. Similarly, colors on dashboards are often used with a purpose. Reds and oranges are usually associated with negative performance, while blues and greens are associated with positive performance. Using colors counterintuitively can cause confusion, so be aware of color usage and your audience and their interpretation.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Be colorblind-friendly</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">A quick Google search told me that “<em class="italic">There are an estimated 300 million people in the world with color vision deficiency. 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women are color blind</em>.” Therefore, it is quite likely that you will have a colorblind or color-vision-deficient person in your audience at some point in your career. Colorblindness is usually manifested as an inability to distinguish between red and green, or blue and yellow. Red/green and blue/yellow are on opposite sides of the color wheel.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Consequently, the challenges these color combinations present for colorblind individuals can be easily recreated with image editing software such as Photoshop. If you are not colorblind, convert an image with these color combinations into grayscale and observe. The challenge presented to the 8.0% of men and 0.5% of women who are colorblind becomes immediately obvious! Or, use the following website to upload an image of your <a/>dashboard and <a/>experience how your user might see the colors used: <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Use pure colors sparingly</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The resulting colors from the following exercise should be a very vibrant red, green, and blue. Depending on the monitor, you may even find it difficult to stare directly at the colors. These are known as <strong class="keyWord">pure colors</strong> and <a/>should be used sparingly, perhaps only to highlight particularly important items or alerts in, for example, breached thresholds.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Please follow these steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the workbook associated with this chapter and navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Pure Colors</code> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select the <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> data source and place <strong class="keyWord">Category</strong> on both the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf and the <strong class="keyWord">Color</strong> shelf.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="keyWord">Fit</strong> to <strong class="keyWord">Entire View</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="keyWord">Color</strong> shelf and choose <strong class="keyWord">Edit Colors...</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Edit Colors</strong> dialog box, select one after the other member—that is, <strong class="screenText">Furniture</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Office Supplies</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Technology</strong>, and select blue, green, and red, respectively:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_02.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application, website&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.2: Colors</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">See for yourself how<a/> you experience looking at those pure colors and select three other, less vibrant, colors to compare. Too vibrant colors can be very heavy on your eye and make it hard to focus. Colors that are too similar, however, are hard to distinguish between. Finding a good balance is key.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Choose color variations over symbol variation</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Deciphering different symbols takes more mental energy for the end user than distinguishing colors. Therefore, color variation<a/> should be used over symbol variation.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">See the following scatter plot for an<a/> example of symbol variation:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_03.png" alt="Chart, scatter chart&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.3: Symbol variation</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">See the same<a/> with<a/> color variation:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_04.png" alt="Chart, scatter chart&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.4: Color variation</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To sum up the color rules, keep your color palette simple and be aware of your regional and cultural color meanings. Also, consider that people in your audience might have a color deficiency; tools can help you choose colors wisely, and Tableau also offers a colorblind palette. Use pure colors sparingly since too many vibrant colors will make it hard for the audience to focus on the important items. Lastly, don’t use too many shapes in one <a/>view; instead, use color to distinguish between categories.</p>&#13;

<section id="ch11lvl1sec71">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Visualization type rules</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">This section deserves a whole <a/>separate book and is interlinked with many other disciplines like storytelling, communication, and persuasion; as such, we won’t take the time here to delve into a lengthy list of visualization-type rules but, rather, highlight a few frequently discussed ones. We will consider keeping simple shapes versus complex ones and the effective use of pie charts.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Keep shapes simple</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Too many shape details impede comprehension. This is because shape details draw the user’s focus away from the data. Consider the following exercise using two different shopping cart images.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s look at the following exercise steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the workbook associated with this chapter and navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Simple Shopping Cart</code> worksheet. Note that the visualization is a scatter plot that shows the top-10-selling subcategories in terms of total sales and profits.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Shapes</code> directory located in the <code class="inlineCode">My</code> <code class="inlineCode">Tableau</code> repository. On my computer, the path is <code class="inlineCode">C:\Users\Marleen Meier\Documents\My</code> <code class="inlineCode">Tableau</code> <code class="inlineCode">Repository\Shapes</code>. Locate the respective Tableau repository on your machine and open the <code class="inlineCode">Shapes</code> directory</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Within the <code class="inlineCode">Shapes</code> directory, create a folder named <code class="inlineCode">My Shapes</code>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Reference the link included in the comment section of the worksheet to download assets associated with this chapter. In the downloaded material, find the images entitled <code class="inlineCode">Shopping_Cart</code> and <code class="inlineCode">Shopping_Cart_3D</code>, and then copy those images into the <code class="inlineCode">My Shapes</code> directory.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In Tableau, access the <code class="inlineCode">Simple Shopping Cart</code> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="keyWord">Shape</strong> shelf and then select <strong class="keyWord">More Shapes</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Within the <strong class="screenText">Edit Shape</strong> dialog box, click the <strong class="screenText">Reload Shapes</strong> button:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_05.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.5: Reload Shapes</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="8">Select the <strong class="keyWord">My Shapes</strong> palette and set the shape to <code class="inlineCode">Shopping_Cart</code>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">After closing the<a/> dialog box, click on the <strong class="keyWord">Size</strong> shelf and adjust as desired. Also, adjust other aspects of the visualization as desired.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">3D Shopping Cart</code> worksheet and then repeat <em class="italic">steps 6–9</em> above. Instead of using <code class="inlineCode">Shopping_Cart</code>, use <code class="inlineCode">Shopping_Cart_3D</code>. See the following screenshot for a comparison of the simple and 3D shopping carts:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_06.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.6: 2D versus 3D</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Compare the two <a/>visualizations. Which version of the shopping cart is more attractive? It’s likely that the cart with the 3D look was your choice. So, why not choose the more attractive image? Making visualizations attractive is only a secondary concern. The primary goal is to display the data as clearly and efficiently as possible. A simple shape is grasped more quickly and intuitively than a complex shape. Besides, the cuteness of the 3D image will quickly wear off.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Use pie charts sparingly</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Edward Tufte makes an acrid comment against the use of pie charts<a/> in his book <em class="italic">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>, saying that a table is always better than a pie chart because we humans fail to interpret the visual dimension of pie charts.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The present sentiment in data visualization circles is largely sympathetic to Tufte’s criticism. There may, however, be some exceptions—that is, some circumstances where a pie chart is optimal. Consider the following visualization:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_07.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.7: Comparing visualizations</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Which of the four <a/>visualizations best demonstrates that A accounts for 25% of the whole? Clearly, it’s the pie chart! Therefore, perhaps it is fairer to refer to pie charts as limited and to use them sparingly, as opposed to considering them inherently undesirable.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Often, building visualizations is a <a/>balancing act. It’s not uncommon to encounter contradictory directions from books, blogs, consultants, and even within organizations. One person may insist on utilizing every pixel of space while another advocates for simplicity and white space. One counsels a guided approach, while another recommends building wide-open dashboards that allow end users to discover their own path. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Avant-garde types may crave esoteric visualizations, while those of a more conservative bent prefer to stay with convention. Let’s explore a few of the more common competing requests and then suggest compromises.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Make the dashboard simple and robust</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Occam’s razor suggests that the simplest possible solution to any problem is probably the right one. Yet, sometimes, even the simplest solution is rather complex. This is OK! Complexity in Tableau dashboarding need not be shunned. But a clear understanding of some basic guidelines can help the author intelligently determine how to compromise between demands for simplicity and demands for robustness:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">More frequent data updates necessitate simpler design</em>: Some Tableau dashboards may be near real-time. Third-party technology may be utilized to force a browser that displays a dashboard via Tableau Server to refresh every few minutes, to ensure the latest data is displayed. In such cases, the design should be quite simple. The end user must be able to see immediately all pertinent data and should not use that dashboard for extensive analysis. Conversely, a dashboard that is refreshed monthly can support high complexity and thus may be used for deep exploration.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">Greater end user expertise supports greater dashboard complexity</em>: Know thy users. If they want easy, at-a-glance visualizations, keep the dashboards simple. If they like deep dives, design accordingly.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">Smaller audiences require more precise design</em>: If only a few people monitor a given dashboard, it may require a highly customized approach. In such cases, specifications may be detailed, which are complex and difficult to execute and maintain. This is because the small user base has expectations that may not be natively easy to produce in Tableau.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">Screen resolution and visualization complexity are proportional</em>: Users with low-resolution<a/> devices will need to interact simply with a dashboard. Thus, the design of such a dashboard will likely be correspondingly uncomplicated. Conversely, high-resolution devices support greater complexity.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><em class="italic">Greater distance from the screen requires larger dashboard elements</em>: If the dashboard is designed for conference room viewing, the elements on the dashboard may need to be large to meet the viewing needs of those far from the screen. Thus, the dashboard will likely be relatively simple. Conversely, a dashboard to be viewed primarily on end users’ desktops can be more complex.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Although these points are all about simple versus complex, do not equate simple with easy. A simple and elegantly designed dashboard can be more difficult to create than a complex dashboard.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">As Steve Jobs said, simplicity can be harder than complexity; however, simplicity can move mountains.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Present dense information well</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Normally, a<a/> line graph should have a max of four or five lines. However, there are times when you may wish to display many lines. A compromise can be achieved by presenting many lines and empowering the end user to highlight as desired. The following line graph displays the percentage of internet usage by country from 2000 to 2012. The user can select a country, which will then change color, and compare it to the rest.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We can see this example<a/> in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_08.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.8: A many-line chart</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">When using line charts versus many-line charts, it should not be important how a line performs compared to a specific other line but, rather, how one line behaves in a lake of other lines.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Tell a story</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In her book <em class="italic">Data Story</em>, Nancy Duarte explains in great detail the various techniques one could use to tell a story with data, and many overlap with visualization design theory, which was discussed earlier. We will now<a/> zoom in on a few new, storytelling-specific aspects: </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Explore data<a/> points to drill deeper into lower levels of aggregation. Visualization in Tooltip (see the <em class="italic">Maximizing documentation on a dashboard</em> section of this chapter) is a great way to do this as well as Actions (see the <em class="italic">Dashboard best practices</em> section of this chapter).</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Relate your data; for example, if a distance, size, time, or speed is hard to grasp, convert it into something known. Or, “<em class="italic">If the Sun were as big as a football and the Moon as big as… then the distance between the two would be from here to x</em>.” Or, as a very specific example, instead of showing the amount of sugar in mg, present it as a count of sugar cubes or relate it to the recommended daily intake.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Use rhetoric to lead the reader through your viewpoint of the story, by incorporating emotive words, rhetorical questions, and interjections.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If your data is somewhat related to humans – and it often is – humanize it. Talk to people and learn about problems; you can then add qualitative information to your dashboard. Watch out to not make assumptions.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You will realize that telling a story isn’t as easy as one might think:</p>&#13;
    <blockquote class="packt_quote">&#13;
      <p class="quote">”Almost everything can be counted and measured. It’s thrilling to treasure-hunt through data and uncover bytes of golden opportunity […]. As you journey through your career, may you master the science of data, and also the art of communicating it.”</p>&#13;
      <p class="cite">Nancy Duarte – Data Story</p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You can choose to tell the story by using directive dashboard design (i.e., a dashboard that guides the viewer), or you could decide to build a dashboard that allows the discovery of numerous stories. Your choice will differ, depending on the given dataset and audience. If you choose to create a platform for story discovery, be sure to take the <em class="italic">New York Times</em> approach suggested by Grimwade in Alberto Cairo’s book <em class="italic">The Functional Art: An Introduction to Information Graphics and Visualization: “Provide hints, pointers, and good documentation to lead your end user to successfully interact with the story you wish to tell or to successfully discover their own story</em>.”</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Maximize documentation on a dashboard</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the <em class="italic">Telling a story</em> section, we<a/> considered the suggestion of providing hints, pointers, and good documentation, but there’s an issue. These things take up space. Dashboard space is precious. Often, Tableau authors are asked to squeeze more and more stuff onto a dashboard and, hence, look for ways to conserve space. Here are some suggestions to maximize documentation on a dashboard while minimally impacting screen real estate:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Craft titles for clear communication</strong>: Titles are expected. Not just a title for a dashboard and worksheets on the dashboard, but also titles for legends, filters, and other objects. These titles can be used for effective and efficient documentation. For instance, a filter should not just read <strong class="keyWord">Market</strong>. Instead, it should say something such as <strong class="keyWord">Select a Market</strong>. Notice the imperative statement. The user is being told to do something, and this is a helpful hint. Adding a couple of words to a title will usually not impact dashboard space.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Use subtitles to relay instructions</strong>: A subtitle will take up some extra space, but it does not have to be much. A small, italicized font immediately underneath a title is an obvious place a user will look for guidance. Consider an example: <strong class="keyWord">red represents loss</strong>. This short sentence could be used as a subtitle that may eliminate the need for a legend and, thus, actually save space.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Use intuitive icons</strong>: Consider a use case of navigating from one dashboard to another. Of course, you could associate an action with some hyperlinked text that states it navigates to another dashboard. But this seems unnecessary when an action can be associated with a small, innocuous arrow, such as what is natively used in PowerPoint, to communicate the same thing.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Store more extensive documentation in a tooltip associated with a help icon</strong>: A small question mark in the upper-right corner of an application is common. Currently, I’m composing this chapter in Word, which has such a question mark. In a Tableau dashboard, the lightbulb icon is often used for the same purpose. This clearly communicates where to go if additional help is required. As shown in the following exercise, it’s easy to create.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Follow these steps to create an informative tooltip to help users:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the workbook associated with this chapter and navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Help</code> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Hover over the light bulb on the worksheet and note the text that appears:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_09.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.9: Lorem ipsum</p>&#13;
    <div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">Note that the <em class="italic">Lorem ipsum...</em> text shown in the preceding screenshot is commonly used by web designers, who borrowed it from typesetters, who have used this Latin text as a placeholder for centuries. Visit <a href="http://www.loremipsum.io" target="_blank"><span class="url">www.loremipsum.io</span></a> to learn more.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The text in this <a/>worksheet was deployed via <strong class="keyWord">Worksheet</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Tooltip</strong>. This worksheet could be thoughtfully placed on a dashboard (for example, in the upper-right corner) to give very detailed documentation that minimally impacts space.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Visualization types</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Another important set of rules is which<a/> visualization to use for what data type! To just pick out a few examples:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">Use a spine chart for deviation data</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use a scatter plot or heatmap for correlation</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use a line chart or seismogram for time series</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use a bar, lollipop, or bump chart for ranking</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use a histogram or box plot for distributions</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use a treemap, grid plot, or waterfall for part of a whole data</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use bars, radar, or bullet graphs to reflect magnitudes</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use flow, dot-density, or heatmaps for spatial data</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Use Sankey charts, waterfall, or network graphs for flows</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">This list is by far not exhaustive; if you want to get additional information on this topic, I highly recommend checking out the <em class="italic">Visual Vocabulary</em> that Andy Kriebel created, which was inspired by the <em class="italic">Financial Times</em> (<a href="https://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/</span></a>), available on Tableau Public: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/andy.kriebel#!/vizhome/VisualVocabulary/VisualVocabulary" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://public.tableau.com/profile/andy.kriebel#!/vizhome/VisualVocabulary/VisualVocabulary</span></a>. Each category contains multiple suitable visualization types; you can click on a given category to see<a/> details:</p>&#13;

    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_11.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.11: Visual Vocabulary – Distribution</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Picking a<a/> well-matching visualization type for your graph is the very start of creating a good dashboard. Make it your priority to spend some time on this topic; it is a crucial decision in most projects.</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Keep visualizations simple</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Some people tire of seeing<a/> the same chart types over and over. This leads to requests such as, can we spice up the dashboard a bit? Normally, such sentiments should be resisted. As stated at the beginning of this chapter, introducing variety for its own sake is counterproductive. Nevertheless, there are times when a less common visualization type may be a better choice than a more popular type. When are those times?</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Use less common chart types in the following scenarios:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">The chart is used to catch the end user’s attention.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">The chart type presents the data more effectively.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Sometimes, a less common chart type can be effectively used to catch the end user’s attention for some goal, such as humor, making a salient point, or making the visualization more memorable. One such example can be found on the Tableau 404 error page. Navigate to <a href="http://www.tableau.com/asdf" target="_blank"><span class="url">http://www.tableau.com/asdf</span></a> and observe Bigfoot in a packed bubble chart. Note that this page changes from time to time, so you may see Elvis, aliens, or some other visualization.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">An example of the second point is using a treemap over a pie chart. Both are non-Cartesian chart types (visualizations with no fields on the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">Columns</strong> shelves) used to show parts of a whole. Pie charts are the more common of the two, but treemaps usually present the data better. There are at least three reasons for this:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">A treemap can represent more data points.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">The rectangular nature of a treemap fits monitor space more efficiently.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Pie slice sizes are more difficult to distinguish than sizes of treemap segments.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Sometimes, using a less common<a/> visualization type may elicit complaints: <em class="italic">I like pie charts. Give me a pie chart!</em> In such cases, a compromise may be possible. Later in this chapter, we will consider sheet swapping. As you will learn, sheet swapping can allow the end user to determine which visualization type to view. In the end, if a compromise is not possible and the person responsible for your paycheck desires a less-than-ideal chart type... well, I recommend you do as they ask!</p>&#13;

<section id="ch11lvl1sec73">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Dashboard design</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now that we have completed our<a/> discussion of visualization theory, let’s turn our attention to dashboard design. We’ll begin by asking the question, what is a dashboard? This is rather difficult to answer; however, its usage in everyday conversation in many organizations would suggest that people have a definite idea as to what a dashboard is. Furthermore, search engine results provide no shortage of definitions. But those definitions can differ significantly and even be contradictory.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Why is it so difficult to define a dashboard? In part, it is because data visualization as a whole, and dashboarding specifically, is an emerging field that combines many other disciplines. These disciplines include statistical analysis, graphic and web design, computer science, and even journalism. An emerging field with so many components is a moving target and, as such, is difficult to define.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">For our purposes, we will begin with Stephen Few’s definition as it first appeared in an issue of <em class="italic">Intelligent Enterprise</em> in 2004. He states that a dashboard is a visual display of vital statistics we need to reach, and all these details are present on a sole screen so that this information can be observed in one place. Then, we’ll extend and adapt that definition for Tableau dashboards.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Although this definition is good, Tableau takes a broader approach. For instance, a Tableau dashboard may be contained on a single screen but can be designed (and quite effectively so) to require scrolling. More importantly, Tableau dashboards are typically interactive, which opens up a world of exploration, analysis, and design options. Therefore, let’s attempt <a/>a Tableau-centric dashboard definition:</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="italic">A Tableau dashboard is a display that contains one or more data visualizations designed to enable a user to quickly view metrics. This display may provide interactive elements, such as filtering, highlighting, and drill-down capabilities that enable further exploration and analysis.</em></p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Dashboard layout</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The layout of a <a/>dashboard is important for the same reason that the layout of a magazine foldout or a web page is important. Placing the right information in the right place helps the viewer quickly and efficiently gather information and draw conclusions. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In order to appreciate this fact, consider the last time you had to hunt through a poorly constructed web page to find important information. Your time could have been better used actually applying that important information!</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">The Golden Ratio layout</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You<a/> have probably heard of the Fibonacci sequence or the Golden Ratio. Since it may have been a few years since you attended a math class, a brief reminder may prove helpful.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where every number is the sum of the previous two numbers—for example, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">A Golden Rectangle is achieved when the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side of a rectangle is approximately 1.618. This ratio is known as the Golden Ratio. Mathematically, the Golden Ratio is represented as follows:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_001.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="normal">You can see the connection between the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden Ratio when dividing each number of the Fibonacci sequence by the previous number; for example, take the following sequence:</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This leads to the following:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_002.png" alt=""/></figure><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_003.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="normal">Now, let’s consider a dashboard layout using the Golden Ratio. The layout shown here is constructed <a/>of rectangles so that each is 1.618 times longer or <a/>taller than the next. The spiral (known as the Golden Spiral) is displayed to demonstrate the order of the rectangles:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_12.png" alt="Diagram&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.12: Golden Ratio (https://www.pixpa.com/blog/golden-ratio)</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The<a/> Fibonacci sequence/Golden Rectangle/Golden Ratio appears endlessly in nature and throughout history. Many seashells and<a/> flowers adhere closely to the Fibonacci sequence. The Great Pyramid of Giza appears to have been constructed with the Golden Ratio in mind. Phidias likely used the Golden Ratio to design his statues for the Athenian Parthenon. Indeed, the Parthenon itself was designed with Golden Rectangle proportions. Even if more recent studies have shown that the ratio can’t be replicated to decimals, nature and art are still very close to the mathematics behind it. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">So, does the Golden Ratio, as pictured in the preceding diagram, represent the ideal dashboard layout? Perhaps it’s more pertinent to say that this image represents one acceptable dashboard layout. The ideal is not so much found in the abstract as it’s found in the application. Dashboard layouts may sometimes approximate the Golden Ratio but, as we will see, other dashboard layouts may be better for different scenarios.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The dashboard pictured here (which is also available in the Tableau workbook that accompanies this chapter) utilizes the Golden Rectangle:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_13.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.13: Golden Rectangle</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Notice that this example does not attempt to follow the Golden Ratio through to smaller and smaller rectangles. There are practical limits.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The <a/>Golden Rectangle layout is particularly good for <a/>guiding the viewer from coarser to finer granularity. In this example, the left portion of the dashboard displays the coarsest granularity, 17 subcategories. The map is next. Finally, the scatter plot displays the finest granularity. Creating actions that follow this path would make a natural interaction for the end user. For example, an end user might first click on <strong class="keyWord">Tables</strong> and then click on the state of<strong class="keyWord"> Pennsylvania</strong> to observe outliers in the scatter plot.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">The quad layout</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The quad layout<a/> divides <a/>a dashboard into four more or less equal quadrants. It’s easy to implement. On a blank dashboard, simply double-click on four worksheets in the <strong class="keyWord">Dashboard</strong> pane. The result is a quad layout, though some small adjustments may need to be made to account for legends, filters, and parameters. To observe a quad layout, refer to the diagram in <em class="italic">Figure 11.7</em>.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">The small multiple layout</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">A small<a/> multiple layout displays <a/>many views on a single dashboard. Like the quad layout, a small multiple layout can be implemented simply by double-clicking on each desired worksheet in the <strong class="keyWord">Dashboard</strong> pane. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Small multiples are useful when viewing information that utilizes the same visualization type repeatedly. Also, a consistent theme is helpful; for example, the following screenshot demonstrates a theme of profit performance per state in the USA. Attempting to create a small multiple layout with multiple visualization types and multiple themes will likely be messy and difficult to interact with:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_14.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.14: Small multiple layouts</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Some layouts are essentially variations of a theme. For instance, a layout that displays three views where one view on the dashboard covers double the real estate of each of the other views may essentially be a variation of the quad layout. Other layouts defy easy categorization and are unique to a given dashboard. Regardless, this will hopefully provide some food <a/>for thought as you design dashboards in the<a/> future.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We already mentioned the next section when we discussed compromises – sheet swapping, which is a great feature for compromises. If your stakeholder asks you to build something you know might not be as good or doesn’t follow a visualization best practice, you can always add a sheet swap, making your stakeholders happy and delivering an alternative to other users. We will walk through a sheet-swapping exercise in the next section.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Utilize sheet swapping</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Sheet selection, often referred to as <a/>sheet swapping, allows the Tableau author to hide and display visualizations, as well as to move worksheets on and off the dashboard. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">These techniques have been used in creative ways with some very impressive results. For example, Tableau Zen Master Joshua Milligan has built various games, including tic-tac-toe and blackjack, using sheet selection. For our purposes, we will stick to using sheet selection to assist with creating dashboards that adhere to the design principles we’ve discussed.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the <em class="italic">Use pie charts sparingly</em> section, we <a/>discussed pie charts and treemaps, and we noted that a treemap is a better visualization. However, people are often more comfortable with pie charts. As a compromise, in the first exercise, we will review an example that allows the end user to choose whether to see a pie chart or a treemap.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Please follow these steps:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">You can use the sheet swap feature in case some of your users prefer one visualization over the other. Next, we will create a filter menu that can be hidden on the dashboard. In the <em class="italic">Maximizing documentation on a dashboard</em> section, the point was made that dashboard space is precious. Therefore, in the second exercise, <em class="italic">Creating a collapsible menu</em>, we will review an example that will use sheet selection to allow the end user to show or hide filters and, thus, make more efficient use of screen real estate.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Create a collapsible menu</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Please follow these <a/>steps to learn how to add a collapsible filter menu to your dashboards:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Duplicate the dashboard we created in the preceding exercise and rename it <code class="inlineCode">Collapsible Menu</code>. If you did not complete the preceding exercise, use the dashboard included in the solution workbook provided with this chapter.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select any of the worksheets on the dashboard and click on the arrow; choose the filters <strong class="screenText">Country</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Years Only</strong> to be displayed.</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_21.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.21: Filters</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="3">The two filters will be placed in a container on the right-hand side of the dashboard. Double-click on the two horizontal lines in the top middle of one filter to select the container instead. The surrounding lines will appear blue. Select <strong class="screenText">Add Show/Hide Button</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_22.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.22: Add Show/Hide Button</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="4">Note that <a/>an <strong class="screenText">X</strong> is visible next to the filters.

    <p class="normal">In this<a/> section, we learned that by using containers and a filter, Tableau can automatically resize the selected worksheet within the container. This feature can be used to make it seem as if a worksheet can be swapped. However, Tableau basically just minimizes one and maximizes the other, even though this is not visible to the user’s eye. Brilliant, isn’t it?</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">After completing this exercise, you may think, OK, the filters do not technically display on the dashboard, but they are still visible at the side. While this is true in Tableau Desktop, if you can upload the workbook to an instance of Tableau Server, you will note that when clicking on the menu icon, the filters appear and disappear and do not display at the side. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The collapsible <a/>menu is a very nice add-on and contributes to the simplicity of your dashboard. If you read the last, third edition of this book, you might remember that it was a tedious process – and more of a workaround than a feature to get a collapsible menu to function. Now, with <strong class="keyWord">Add Show/Hide Button</strong>, it is a piece of cake. Users can focus on the data and use the filter only if needed.</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Dashboard best practices </h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Visualization<a/> best practices are not limited to visual features; actions, filters, and organizing data can be just as important. A few of those features that Tableau has to offer shall be mentioned in this section. Each of them will help you to either improve the user experience or keep track of what you have built—since, sometimes, you can get lost when working with many different worksheets.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We will start by discussing six different types of <strong class="keyWord">Actions</strong>,<strong class="keyWord"> </strong>followed by the <strong class="keyWord">Download</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Navigation Object</strong>, then the <strong class="keyWord">Used In feature</strong>, and lastly, the <strong class="keyWord">Item Hierarchy.</strong> All contribute to a better dashboard-building experience. Let’s start!</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Actions</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Implicitly, we have discussed this a few times before, but let’s have an explicit look at what we can achieve with regard to visualization and dashboard design by using <strong class="keyWord">Actions</strong>. Actions <a/>come into play if you want your user to be redirected by clicking or hovering on data in a visualization. This can be helpful if you have a lot of data to show and don’t want to put it all on the same dashboard. Neither should you, because it is distracting, and if it is hierarchical data, actions are the perfect way to implement a drill-down technique.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The following sections will explain all the different actions you can use in Tableau to add interactivity, supporting a clean and effective dashboard design.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Filter actions</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this example, we will use a filter action<a/> to show data initially hidden. By doing so, we will make sure<a/> to present smaller chunks of data at a time, and the user can drill down to any point of interest. Follow these steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Please open the worksheet <code class="inlineCode">Quantity by State</code>:&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_24.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.24: Map</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You can see in<a/> the preceding screenshot that each state represents the<a/> quantity of a given product sold. But wouldn’t it be nice to see more details by clicking on a given state? In order to do so, we must set up actions.</p></li>&#13;
    </ol><ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="2">First, we need a second worksheet we want to use in our action. Please open the worksheet <code class="inlineCode">Profit by State by Category</code>:&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_25.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.25: Table</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You can see in the preceding screenshot that every state, every category, and the corresponding profit are shown.</p></li>&#13;
    </ol><ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="3">Now, go <a/>back to the worksheet <code class="inlineCode">Quantity by State</code> to enable an action <a/>that will prompt the user to go to the <code class="inlineCode">Profit by State by Category</code> worksheet, and then filter it on the state they clicked on.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">On the <code class="inlineCode">Quantity by State</code> worksheet, select <strong class="keyWord">Worksheet </strong>| <strong class="keyWord">Actions</strong>; the following window will appear. Click on the <strong class="screenText">Add Action</strong> button and select <strong class="screenText">Filter...</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_26.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.26: Filter action</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="5">In the next <a/>window, add a filter action called <strong class="screenText">Map to table (quantity to profit)</strong> and copy<a/> the settings, as shown in the screenshot. Then, click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_27.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.27: Filter Action parameter</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="6">If you now click on a state on the worksheet <code class="inlineCode">Quantity</code> <code class="inlineCode">by</code> <code class="inlineCode">State</code> <code class="inlineCode">(Source Sheet)</code>, Tableau will look for that same <strong class="screenText">State</strong> on the target sheet and filter accordingly. The following is an example after clicking on <strong class="screenText">Texas</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_28.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.28: Filtered table</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The filter action<a/> discussed in this section can be used to declutter your dashboard. Following<a/> design principles often means less is more, and if you have lots of data points to share, a drill-down or filter action can help you achieve this goal. Present high-level data first, then present a more detailed data layer behind a filter action. You can also add a sentence for your users below the title, like <em class="italic">Click on a state to see more details</em>.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Highlight actions</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Other options are, for example, a highlight action. This is more useful for worksheets on the same page because it will simply<a/> highlight applicable fields. You can show all data on the same <a/>dashboard, but the highlight action makes it easier for your users to find related data points. Follow these steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Please open the dashboard <code class="inlineCode">Qty &amp; Profit</code>, which combines the two worksheets we used previously:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_29.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.29: Dashboard</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="2">Click<a/> on <strong class="keyWord">Dashboard</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Actions</strong>, and this time, copy the<a/> following <strong class="keyWord">Highlight Action</strong> parameters:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_30.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.30: Highlight Action</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="3">The<a/> preceding parameters mean that, on the <code class="inlineCode">Qty</code> <code class="inlineCode">&amp;</code> <code class="inlineCode">Profit</code> dashboard, our <a/>source worksheet will be <code class="inlineCode">Quantity</code><strong class="keyWord"> </strong><code class="inlineCode">by</code><strong class="keyWord"> </strong><code class="inlineCode">State</code>, and by hovering over it, the corresponding data on the target sheet will be highlighted. In this case, the only common data is <strong class="keyWord">State</strong>, so the highlighter will only take <strong class="keyWord">State </strong>into account. The result looks like this:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_31.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.31: Highlight Action dashboard</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">By hovering over Arizona on the map, the same state will be highlighted in the right-hand table. As you can see, implementing a highlight filter can help your users find related data points faster. In contrast to the navigation action, this filter should be used for worksheets on the same page and as visual help to find a value.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">URL actions</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The next action is the <a/>URL action. This one allows you to open a URL when clicking on a data point <a/>in the dashboard. Follow these steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Go to the <code class="inlineCode">Quantity by State</code> worksheet and open <strong class="keyWord">Worksheet </strong>| <strong class="keyWord">Actions</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Delete every action that is visible.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Now, select <strong class="keyWord">Add Action</strong> and select <strong class="keyWord">Go to URL...</strong>. Copy all the parameters, as shown below, and click on the arrow next to the Wikipedia URL. Fields from your data source will appear, which enables you to add a field to the URL that will <a/>automatically <a/>return a value based on the dashboard. Select <strong class="screenText">State</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_32.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.32: URL action</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="4">Click on a state on your map on the <strong class="keyWord">Quantity by State</strong> worksheet, and see how Wikipedia will open the respective web page.</li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">URL actions <a/>are very <a/>useful when you want to show your users additional information available on websites. You can also use latitude and longitude values to open Google Maps or link the URL action to internal company websites with regulations, or maybe a ticketing system.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Navigation actions</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The next action used to be<a/> commonly <a/>used in combination with a button to give the user a more interactive experience. Instead of clicking on tabs to go from one to another page, you will add buttons with an action to go to a specific sheet:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Go to <a/>the <code class="inlineCode">Qty &amp; Profit</code> dashboard and create a calculated field <a/>called <code class="inlineCode">String</code> with the code <code class="inlineCode">"Go back to […]"</code>. This will serve as our button shortly.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Open a new worksheet and call it <code class="inlineCode">Button</code>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Place the calculated field <strong class="screenText">String</strong> by dragging and dropping <strong class="screenText">Details</strong> as well as <strong class="screenText">Label</strong> onto it.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="screenText">Shape</strong> from the <strong class="screenText">Marks</strong> card dropdown and select any shape (and color) of your choice.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Hide the title and disable <strong class="keyWord">Tooltip</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="keyWord">Label</strong> and select <strong class="keyWord">Bottom-Center Alignment</strong>. The result will look as follows:</li>&#13;

    <p class="normal">Those were the six Tableau actions; with the <strong class="keyWord">Filter</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Highlight</strong> actions, you can make it easier for your users to find more detailed information by drilling down. The <strong class="keyWord">Go to Sheet</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Go to URL</strong> actions can be seen as interactive buttons that will redirect your user to additional information, either on the web or on another sheet. And lastly, the <strong class="keyWord">Change Parameter</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Change</strong> <strong class="keyWord">Set</strong> actions can be used to adjust a predefined value or multiple values, which will allow your users to interact with and analyze the data from different angles.</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">A Tableau workbook as well as Tableau dashboards can become very overwhelming, depending on how many worksheets are used to create them. Luckily, Tableau helps us with organizational features like <strong class="keyWord">Item hierarchy</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Used In</strong>.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Item hierarchy</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">As we briefly mentioned in<a/> the <em class="italic">Creating a collapsible menu</em> section, if you open the <code class="inlineCode">Latin American Population</code> dashboard, you will notice <strong class="keyWord">Item hierarchy</strong> at the bottom left of the <strong class="keyWord">Layout</strong> pane. By clicking on the arrow next to the word <strong class="keyWord">Tiled</strong>, you will be able to see all the different parts of the dashboards and the worksheets used in each container. You can also spot containers in containers and the structure of your layout:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_48.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.48: Item hierarchy extended</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Try to keep a logical order within your item hierarchy. This will make it easier for you to make changes to your dashboard later on. Which logic you choose is up to you; one I use often is high-level to more detailed, most important to least important, or from spacious worksheets to smaller ones. A nice article on keeping your dashboard clean can be found here: <a href="https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/joe-beaven/layout-containers-how-to-get-your-item-hierarchy-under-control" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/joe-beaven/layout-containers-how-to-get-your-item-hierarchy-under-control</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Used In</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Used In</strong> feature<a/> shows you on which dashboards a certain worksheet is used. Just right-click on a worksheet and select <strong class="keyWord">Used In</strong>:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_49.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.49: Used In </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This<a/> feature is especially useful if you want to make changes to a worksheet. Before execution, you can check which dashboards will be affected, and the risk of breaking an existing dashboard will decrease tremendously.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Something extra</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">When I first <a/>started using Tableau I was, and still am, a really big fan of Makeover Monday (<a href="https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk</span></a>). Makeover Monday is an initiative hosted by Eva Murray and Andy Kriebel. Every Monday, the Tableau community (you) is given a dataset accompanied by a visualization and asked to improve it. Those can come from newspapers or websites for example. The participants will then analyze the dataset, build a dashboard, and publish that version on Twitter using the hashtag <strong class="keyWord">#makeovermonday</strong>. If you compare the work from the community with the original work, you will surely learn to see which dashboards work best and which designs you prefer, and thus you can slowly develop your own style, especially when participating.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The learnings from the first years of Makeover Monday were summarized in a book with the same title. In 2022, Makeover Monday took a break but is back now in a slightly different format and led by Andy alone. Check it out; it is worth it. Below are some examples and my explanation of why it works; you will recognize the rules we have discussed in this chapter (which I will put in brackets):</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The first example was published in <em class="italic">The Guardian</em> and shows a decrease in exported goods in the UK in January 2020.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Link to the data: <a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w13" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w13</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_50.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.50: UK exports</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">What works?</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Using a line <a/>chart (rule: keeping visualizations simple) for time series data is a good idea. I also like that the line is red (rule: psychological implications of colors) because the visualization is showing something negative, a steep drop in exports. The Y-axis indicates the monetary value of those changes, giving me as the user an idea of the absolute loss. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now let’s see what the Makeover Monday folks came up with: </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Kimberly Furdell created the chart shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.51</em> and without reading much further, ask yourself, what are the differences compared to the original visualization, and which one do you prefer and why?</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Link to the visualization: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kimberly.furdell/viz/UKexportstoEU_16172321299550/Dashboard1" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kimberly.furdell/viz/UKexportstoEU_16172321299550/Dashboard1</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_51.png" alt="Application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.51: Brexit exports</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Why it works better</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The story <a/>from the article published in <em class="italic">The Guardian</em> revolved around the 40% drop in exports in January 2021 compared to January 2020. That the number was related to the previous year was not clear in the original visualization, and Kimberly has enough information in her visualization that you do not need to read the full article to understand (rule: maximizing documentation on a dashboard). To support the storyline further, Kimberly did an excellent job in changing the graph. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This visualization works better because the <em class="italic">Y</em>-axis shows a percentage. Now, you can clearly see that the drop in January 2021 is more severe than the drop in 2020, which looked similar to the original graph because of the nature of absolute values. Increasing the time series data by more years stresses that the developments are outside the past years’ range. The gray lines on her dashboard represent the various export categories, and as such, it is a great idea to have an area chart for the total values, and line charts, in a less prominent color, for the details (rule: presenting dense information, using pure colors sparingly). The reference lines indicating events during this period of time make the story complete (rule: telling a story). Lastly, users wondering which category contributed the most to the drastic export decline can select a second view, a horizontal bar chart, from the drop-down menu (design: sheet swapping).</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Next, we will look at another Makeover Monday challenge and two examples of how to do it better. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This time, we are concerned about the caffeine content in various coffees from different known chains. The article and data were initially published on <a href="http://www.which.co.uk" target="_blank"><span class="url">www.which.co.uk</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Link to the challenge: <a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w9" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w9</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Here you can find the<a/> original visualization, which is not that bad in my opinion:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_52.png" alt="Chart&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.52: Coffee</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">What works?</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The coffee cup images are good; without checking the table or reading the header, you will know that this visualization is about coffee. It will catch your attention. There is a limited use of colors but the background is not my favorite; the blue is catchy but unrelated to the topic and a bit heavy on the eye. The table, however, works; is it easy to compare the different drinks per brand and the same drinks across different brands (rule: keep it simple and robust). </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Showing the caffeine as well as the ml amount is almost too much information and could be better normalized. But let’s see what the Tableau community came up with. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This first example, <em class="italic">Figure 11.53</em>, was published by Will Sutton. He created a story, where each page is a step toward the <a/>improved version. What a great idea! </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Link to the visualization: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wjsutton/viz/HighStreetCaffeine/ImprovingabarchartMakeoverMonday2023Week9" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wjsutton/viz/HighStreetCaffeine/ImprovingabarchartMakeoverMonday2023Week9</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_53.png" alt="Chart&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.53: Callouts</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Why it works better</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Part of why it works better can be seen next to the horizontal bar chart; the numbers were put into context (rule: telling a story). Other than that, Will changed the table to a very simple bar chart; he focuses on one drink only and marks the highest possible health risk by imposing espresso in a dark red (rules: making a dashboard simple and robust, simple colors). He walks the user through a story, whereas the original table leaves a lot of room for context and answers to unknown questions.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">But I will show you a <a/>redo with all the coffee chains and all the drinks too; this next one is by Gabriela Comanescu.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Link to the visualization: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gabriela.comanescu/viz/HowmuchcaffeineisinyourcoffeeMakeoverMonday/Coffee" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gabriela.comanescu/viz/HowmuchcaffeineisinyourcoffeeMakeoverMonday/Coffee</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_11_54.png" alt="Graphical user interface&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.54: Caffeine</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Why it works better</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Gabriela picked up the theme of the original post, using coffee as an image to catch the user’s attention. She, however, used a true-to-life image of coffee beans as background for her visualization, rather than an illustration. Her color choice is very simple; the font is kept in an off-white color, which could almost be the milk on top of the coffee (rule: simple colors). But what I like the most is that she normalized the data. For all beverages, she is showing the caffeine in mg per 100 ml. This makes every drink comparable, and hence, it makes sense to plot them each as a circular bar chart. Within seconds, the user can spot the highest caffeine content per drink and is able to compare them with each other too. Using a circular bar is genius, because it looks to me like stirring the coffee (rule: making a dashboard simple and robust, presenting dense information, and psychological implications of colors).</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">That was my take on<a/> Makeover Monday, and I hope, by now, you are a fan too. If you ever tweet your version of any given dataset, please tag <strong class="keyWord">#MasteringTableau</strong> so that readers of this book and I can check out your work.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Last but not least, another page that I highly <a/>recommend is Visual Capitalist (<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.visualcapitalist.com</span></a>). Its dashboards are so perfectly designed that you should really try and learn from them.</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Summary</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">We began this chapter by considering visualization design theory. We looked at formatting rules, color rules, and rules about which visualization types to use and which we need to avoid. We also explored how to compromise when contradictory design goals are expressed by end users. Then, we discussed dashboard design principles. We covered three popular layouts: the Golden Rectangle, quad, and small multiple.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Afterward, we looked at how to use sheet selection techniques as an ally in good design. Specifically, we explored how to allow the end user to choose which visualization type to view, and how to hide and display filters so as to make the best use of screen real estate. Next, we discussed actions and download buttons for a better user experience, as well as item hierarchies and the <strong class="keyWord">Used In</strong> feature, which is very handy for organizing your dashboard. This, in turn, will help to improve the layout design. Finally, to combine everything we learned, we analyzed three Makeover Monday dashboards and explained why those work based on the rules discussed prior.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will focus on use cases. Going from a dataset to a product will be the theme, and we will practice doing this with, inter alia, geospatial data. The knowledge you gained from the previous chapters will be very useful!</p>&#13;
