    visualization, focusing specifically on dashboard design. By exploring how to
    present data in a visually compelling and informative manner, you will gain the
    knowledge and learn techniques that will help to create impactful dashboards to
    effectively communicate insights, drive decision-making, and engage your audience.
    This chapter was influenced by some giants in data visualization: *The Functional
    Art* by Alberto Cairo, *Information Dashboard Design* by Stephen Few, *The Big
    Book of Dashboards* by Steve Wexley, Jeffrey Shaffer, and Andy Cotgraeve, *Universal

    Fonts are, of course, an obvious formatting consideration. Lines and bands, however,
    may not be something you typically work with—but in Tableau, lines and bands should
    certainly be considered. This illustrates that data visualization is closely related
    to graphic design, where lines and bands play a much bigger role than they do
    in, for example, Excel, and that formatting considers much more than just the
    textual layout.

    regional and cultural color meanings. Also, consider that people in your audience
    might have a color deficiency; tools can help you choose colors wisely, and Tableau
    also offers a colorblind palette. Use pure colors sparingly since too many vibrant
    colors will make it hard for the audience to focus on the important items. Lastly,
    don’t use too many shapes in one view; instead, use color to distinguish between

    a dashboard? This is rather difficult to answer; however, its usage in everyday
    conversation in many organizations would suggest that people have a definite idea
    as to what a dashboard is. Furthermore, search engine results provide no shortage
    of definitions. But those definitions can differ significantly and even be contradictory.

    as a whole, and dashboarding specifically, is an emerging field that combines
    many other disciplines. These disciplines include statistical analysis, graphic
    and web design, computer science, and even journalism. An emerging field with
    so many components is a moving target and, as such, is difficult to define.

    present on a sole screen so that this information can be observed in one place.

    design options. Therefore, let’s attempt a Tableau-centric dashboard definition:'

    automatically resize the selected worksheet within the container. This feature
    can be used to make it seem as if a worksheet can be swapped. However, Tableau
    basically just minimizes one and maximizes the other, even though this is not
    visible to the user’s eye. Brilliant, isn’t it?

    look at what we can achieve with regard to visualization and dashboard design
    by using **Actions**. Actions come into play if you want your user to be redirected
    by clicking or hovering on data in a visualization. This can be helpful if you
    have a lot of data to show and don’t want to put it all on the same dashboard.
    Neither should you, because it is distracting, and if it is hierarchical data,
    actions are the perfect way to implement a drill-down technique.

    Makeover Monday ([https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk)).
    Makeover Monday is an initiative hosted by Eva Murray and Andy Kriebel. Every
    Monday, the Tableau community (you) is given a dataset accompanied by a visualization
    and asked to improve it. Those can come from newspapers or websites for example.
    The participants will then analyze the dataset, build a dashboard, and publish
    that version on Twitter using the hashtag **#makeovermonday**. If you compare
    the work from the community with the original work, you will surely learn to see
    which dashboards work best and which designs you prefer, and thus you can slowly
    develop your own style, especially when participating.

    it. Below are some examples and my explanation of why it works; you will recognize

    40% drop in exports in January 2021 compared to January 2020\. That the number
    was related to the previous year was not clear in the original visualization,
    and Kimberly has enough information in her visualization that you do not need
    to read the full article to understand (rule: maximizing documentation on a dashboard).
    To support the storyline further, Kimberly did an excellent job in changing the
    graph.'

    you can clearly see that the drop in January 2021 is more severe than the drop
    in 2020, which looked similar to the original graph because of the nature of absolute
    values. Increasing the time series data by more years stresses that the developments
    are outside the past years’ range. The gray lines on her dashboard represent the
    various export categories, and as such, it is a great idea to have an area chart
    for the total values, and line charts, in a less prominent color, for the details
    (rule: presenting dense information, using pure colors sparingly). The reference
    lines indicating events during this period of time make the story complete (rule:
    telling a story). Lastly, users wondering which category contributed the most
    to the drastic export decline can select a second view, a horizontal bar chart,
    from the drop-down menu (design: sheet swapping).'

    highest possible health risk by imposing espresso in a dark red (rules: making

    to catch the user’s attention. She, however, used a true-to-life image of coffee
    beans as background for her visualization, rather than an illustration. Her color
    choice is very simple; the font is kept in an off-white color, which could almost
    be the milk on top of the coffee (rule: simple colors). But what I like the most
    is that she normalized the data. For all beverages, she is showing the caffeine
    in mg per 100 ml. This makes every drink comparable, and hence, it makes sense
    to plot them each as a circular bar chart. Within seconds, the user can spot the
    highest caffeine content per drink and is able to compare them with each other
    too. Using a circular bar is genius, because it looks to me like stirring the
    coffee (rule: making a dashboard simple and robust, presenting dense information,
    and psychological implications of colors).'

    at formatting rules, color rules, and rules about which visualization types to
    use and which we need to avoid. We also explored how to compromise when contradictory
    design goals are expressed by end users. Then, we discussed dashboard design principles.
    We covered three popular layouts: the Golden Rectangle, quad, and small multiple.'

    good design. Specifically, we explored how to allow the end user to choose which
    visualization type to view, and how to hide and display filters so as to make
    the best use of screen real estate. Next, we discussed actions and download buttons
    for a better user experience, as well as item hierarchies and the **Used In**
    feature, which is very handy for organizing your dashboard. This, in turn, will
    help to improve the layout design. Finally, to combine everything we learned,
    we analyzed three Makeover Monday dashboards and explained why those work based
    on the rules discussed prior.
