<h1 class="chapterTitle">Improving Performance</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Once people are familiar with Tableau’s functionality, they soon run into another type of issue: performance. You might all have experienced staring at the screen while reading <em class="italic">Loading Data</em> or <em class="italic">Executing Query</em>. But don’t worry, we’ve got you! If designed accordingly, Tableau dashboards can perform very well, even with large amounts of data.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This chapter will address various aspects of performance with the intent of empowering you with techniques to create workbooks that load quickly and respond snappily to end user interaction.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">Understanding the performance-recording dashboard</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Hardware and on-the-fly techniques</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Connecting to data sources</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Working with extracts</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Using filters wisely</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Efficient calculations</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Other ways to improve performance</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">As you can see, there are many topics we have to cover with regard to performance improvement. Therefore, let’s not lose any time and dive right in. Our first topic will be performance recording, which is the first thing you should look at when experiencing a drop in performance because it helps you identify the source of all the slowness.</p>&#13;

<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau includes a performance-recording feature as part of the installation package and it ships as <a/>a dashboard named <code class="inlineCode">PerformanceRecording.twb</code>. The dashboard gives the Tableau author an easy way to understand and troubleshoot performance problems. The following exercises and associated discussion points will review various aspects of the performance-recording dashboard, including how to generate it, how to use it to improve performance, and how it’s constructed.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Perform the following steps:</p>&#13;

      <li class="numberedList">Press <em class="keystroke">F5</em> on Windows or <em class="keystroke">Command</em> + <em class="keystroke">R</em> on macOS to refresh the view.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="keyWord">Help</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Settings and Performance</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Stop Performance Recording</strong>. A new dashboard will open:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_01.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.1: Performance summary</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">There are four main parts to be looked at:</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">A) Performance Summary</strong> shows the amount of time the dashboard needed to execute all the steps that happened between <em class="italic">step 3</em> (start performance recording) and <em class="italic">step 5</em> (stop performance recording). The slider can be used to filter.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">B) Timeline</strong> shows which step happened when and how long it took.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">C)</strong> The steps are also <a/>color-coded and can be found in the <strong class="keyWord">Events</strong> bar chart as well.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">D) Query</strong> will only show details when clicking on any event in (<strong class="keyWord">B</strong>) or (<strong class="keyWord">C</strong>).</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s continue with the next steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Drag the <strong class="keyWord">Events</strong> timeline slider in (<strong class="keyWord">A</strong>) to the far left to show all events.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Within <strong class="keyWord">Events Sorted by Time</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">C</strong>), click on any green bar entitled <strong class="keyWord">Executing Query</strong>. Note that the <strong class="keyWord">Query</strong> section is now populated by the VizQL belonging to the highlighted bar:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_02.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.2: Events</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="3">To see the query in its entirety, navigate to the <strong class="keyWord">Query</strong> worksheet and set the fit to <strong class="keyWord">Entire View</strong> (by <strong class="keyWord">Query</strong>, Tableau is referring to a VizQL query). Note that an especially long query may not be recorded in its entirety. In order to see every line of such a query, reference the log files located in <strong class="keyWord">My Tableau Repository</strong>.</li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">The preceding steps were intended to provide you with an initial look at what the performance-recording dashboard can be used for. I usually use it to check whether a particular query took significantly longer than others. I then look at the query on the <strong class="keyWord">Query</strong> tab and check <a/>which part is affected by reading the fields used, try to change it, and then run the performance dashboard again to see how things change. Now, let’s look at some more details.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you access the <strong class="keyWord">Events</strong> worksheet from the performance-recording dashboard, you will see the different events. We will now discuss those events and their impact on performance in more detail:</p>&#13;

        </tr></tbody></table><p class="normal">After this overview, which you can always come back to, we will dive a little deeper and research what happens when performance recording is activated. Note that the following assumes that the author is working on Tableau Desktop and not Tableau Server. In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud</em>, we will cover performance recording on Tableau Server.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">When recording performance, Tableau initially creates a file in <code class="inlineCode">My Tableau Repository\Logs</code>, named <code class="inlineCode">performance_[timestamp].tab</code>. Additionally, there is a file named <code class="inlineCode">PerformanceRecording_new.twb</code> located in the Tableau program directory, for example, <code class="inlineCode">C:\Program Files\Tableau\Tableau.[version]\Performance</code>. That file is automatically opened once the recording stops, thereby allowing the author to peruse the results.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We just learned how <a/>we can record performance metrics and use the dashboard that ships with Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server (if enabled by admin) on said topic. In the next sections, we will guide you step by step through the different options that you can consider to improve the overall performance.</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">Even though Tableau Desktop does not need a lot in terms of hardware, it still happens that company desktops or laptops are underpowered, especially if you are a so-called business user who does not require programming tools or lots of processing power in your day-to-day work. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Therefore, in this section, we will discuss the technical requirements. As per <a href="http://www.tableau.com" target="_blank"><span class="url">www.tableau.com</span></a>, the latest technical requirements are:</p>&#13;

          </td>&#13;
        </tr></tbody></table><p class="normal">Now that we have our basics straight, let us take a look at a feature that can slow down your performance unwillingly and how to solve it. Our first on-the-fly technique is called auto updates.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Auto updates can be accessed either via the icon located on the toolbar, via <strong class="keyWord">Worksheet</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Auto Updates</strong>, or by <a/>using the shortcut key <em class="keystroke">F10</em> on Windows or <em class="keystroke">Option</em> + <em class="keystroke">Command</em> + <em class="keystroke">0</em> on Mac. Auto updates give the author the option of pausing/resuming auto updates for the worksheet and/or for filters and can come in very handy if you want to make multiple changes to your layout but want to avoid Tableau loading after every change because every load means a new query is sent to your underlying data source and has to be processed, which will cost processing power. You can simply pause the update, make your changes, and then run the update once.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The following exercise demonstrates how this works:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the workbook associated with this chapter and navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Auto Updates</code> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane, select the <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> dataset.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Place <strong class="keyWord">State</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Deselect <strong class="screenText">Auto Update Worksheet</strong> via the toolbar:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_03.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.3: Auto Update Worksheet</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="5">Place <strong class="keyWord">City</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf to the right of <strong class="keyWord">State</strong>. Note that the view does not update.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Enable <strong class="keyWord">Auto Update Worksheet</strong> via the toolbar. The view now updates.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Right-click on <strong class="keyWord">State</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf and select <strong class="keyWord">Show Filter</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Right-click on <strong class="keyWord">City</strong> on <a/>the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf and select <strong class="keyWord">Show Filter</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">On the <strong class="keyWord">City</strong> filter, click the drop-down menu and select <strong class="screenText">Multiple Values</strong><strong class="keyWord"> (</strong><strong class="screenText">list</strong><strong class="keyWord">) </strong>and <strong class="screenText">Only Relevant Values</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_04.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.4: Only Relevant Values</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="10">Deselect <strong class="keyWord">Auto Update Filters</strong> as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.3</em>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="keyWord">State </strong>filter, select only <strong class="keyWord">Alabama</strong>. Note that the <strong class="keyWord">City </strong>filter<strong class="keyWord"> </strong>does not update.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Enable <strong class="keyWord">Auto Update Filters</strong> via the toolbar. The <strong class="keyWord">City</strong> filter now updates.</li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">Auto updates can be very helpful. The author may pause auto updates, make multiple changes, and then resume auto updates, thereby saving time and increasing performance indirectly.</p>&#13;
    <div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">As a side note, cascading filters such as <strong class="keyWord">Only Relevant Values</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">All Values in Context</strong> may not populate when using the pause button or auto updates as they are reliant on a query being passed first.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">The Run Update feature</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Run Update</strong> icon to the right of the pause/resume auto updates option is meant to refresh once, while the user <a/>can keep the disabled <strong class="keyWord">Auto Update</strong> feature in place. The following brief example should help clarify this option:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Duplicate the <strong class="keyWord">previous</strong> worksheet called <code class="inlineCode">Auto Updates</code> and name the duplicate <code class="inlineCode">Run Updates</code>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Pause all updates by clicking on the <strong class="keyWord">Pause Auto Updates</strong> icon.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select several states at random in the <strong class="keyWord">State </strong>filter.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="keyWord">Run Update</strong> icon as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.5</em> and select either <strong class="keyWord">Update Filters</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">Update Worksheet</strong>. The shortcut key for running an update is <em class="keystroke">F9</em> on Windows. The shortcut on macOS is <em class="keystroke">Shift</em> + <em class="keystroke">Command</em> + <em class="keystroke">0</em>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_05.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.5: Running an update</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="5">Select several more states at random in the <strong class="keyWord">State </strong>filter. Note that auto updating is still paused.</li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">To repeat, <strong class="keyWord">Run Update</strong> allows the Tableau author to intermittently refresh the view while keeping auto updates paused. The two update features that we just discussed will make your life as a dashboard developer easier by being able to make multiple changes before loading and hence waiting for the refreshed data, but if you want to tackle performance issues at their core, you need some more tools to hand. The following section will introduce extracts, a really good feature for speeding up calculations and rendering in general.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Small extracts</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Although extracts will be discussed in more detail in the <em class="italic">Working with extracts</em> section, it seems fitting <a/>to mention extracts in the context of performance considerations while authoring. Even under optimal conditions, working with large data sources can be slow. If constant access to the entire dataset while authoring is not necessary, consider creating a small, local extract. Author as much of the workbook as possible and then, when all the underlying data is truly needed, point to the original data source.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The following steps show a brief example of this technique in action:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">In the workbook associated with this chapter, navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Small Local Extract</code> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">New Data Source</strong> to choose a desired data source. This exercise assumes <code class="inlineCode">Superstore.xls</code>, which installs with Tableau, but you can take any dataset you like.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Drag any field to the <strong class="keyWord">Text</strong> shelf. In my example, I used <code class="inlineCode">Number</code> <code class="inlineCode">of</code> <code class="inlineCode">Records</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong>which is a calculated field containing solely the number 1.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Right-click on the data source (for me: <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code>) and select <strong class="screenText">Extract Data…</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_06.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.6: Extracting data</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="5">At the bottom of the <strong class="keyWord">Extract Data…</strong> dialog box, select <strong class="keyWord">Top</strong>, your data source, and <a/>choose <strong class="keyWord">1000</strong>. In the following figure, <strong class="keyWord">Orders</strong> has been chosen, which is one of the two parts of the superstore join:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_07.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.7: Top rows</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="6">Click the <strong class="screenText">Extract</strong> button and note that number of records now displays <code class="inlineCode">1000</code> rows.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane, right-click on <strong class="keyWord">Superstore</strong> and deselect <strong class="keyWord">Use Extract</strong>. Note that <strong class="keyWord">Number of Records</strong> has reverted to its original value.</li>&#13;
    </ol><div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">By creating a small, local extract, the Tableau author alleviates two performance inhibitors: network latency and dataset size.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This section gave you the knowledge of how to reduce your dataset temporarily and the option to get back to <a/>the original size, both without leaving the Tableau interface.

<h1 class="heading-1">Connecting to data sources</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">One of the beauties of Tableau is the ease with which you can connect to many different data sources in <a/>various ways. As mentioned earlier in this book, there are many connectors defined in Tableau for interfacing with a variety of data sources. Furthermore, this flexibility extends beyond simply connecting to single tables or files.</p>&#13;
    <div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">Although Tableau makes it easy to connect to various data sources, it should be stressed that Tableau is not an <strong class="keyWord">Extract, Transform, and Load</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">ETL</strong>) tool. If complex joins and <a/>complex data blending are required to generate useful results, it may be advisable to perform ETL work outside of Tableau, for example, in Tableau Prep Builder (see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Using Tableau Prep Builder</em>, for more information on this service). ETL work will ideally lead to better data modeling and thus easier authoring and quicker performance in Tableau.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The four ways in which Tableau connects to data are as follows:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">Tableau may connect to a single table. This is ideal as it allows the most functionality and easiest troubleshooting while enabling Tableau to send the simplest queries and thus perform optimally. However, it is not always possible to connect to a single table and, although ideal, it is not reasonable to have such a strict limitation. The relationship between data sources and reporting tools is constantly changing. A reporting tool that is inflexible in the way it can connect to data will likely not be successful, no matter how elegant and beautiful the end results.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">The second option is relationships, a newer, more flexible way to combine two or more datasets. The level of detail will be defined per worksheet rather than in the <strong class="keyWord">Data Source</strong> tab, which makes this feature very powerful.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">The third way in which Tableau may connect to data is via joining. One table may not supply all the necessary data, but by joining two or more tables, all the needed data may be accessible. As the joins become more and more complex, performance may be impacted, and troubleshooting may become difficult. Fortunately, Tableau can assume referential integrity and thus work quite efficiently with even complex joins. More information can be found here: <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/joins_xbd_perf.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/joins_xbd_perf.htm</span></a>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Finally, Tableau may utilize data blending. Data blending often performs admirably, provided no more than one of the blended data sources is large and dimensions that are used for blending have relatively few members.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Relationships should be chosen over joining and joining should be chosen instead of blending whenever <a/>possible. When blending multiple, large data sources, performance can be seriously impacted. The problem is further compounded when blending on high-cardinality dimensions. Also, data blending limits some functionality, such as the ability to use dimensions, row-level calculations, or LOD expressions, from a secondary data source.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">However, there are exceptions, two of which are discussed here:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">First, data blending is advantageous (and usually necessary) when there is no common key shared <a/>between two tables.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Secondly, in some instances, cross-joining will not work, and a data blend is required. For example, use <a/>data blending when you work with two datasets that have different granularities and relationships are not possible or when a cross-database join is not possible (for example, to cubes or extract-only connections), or when you have big datasets for which a blend will improve performance.</li>&#13;
    </ul><div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">More info can be found here: <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/multiple_connections.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/multiple_connections.htm</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <p class="normal">For these reasons, consider as a guideline that data blending should normally be avoided if a joining option exists.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Learning about Joins, Blends, and Data Structures</em>, provides detailed information about joining and blending. For the purposes of this chapter, joining and blending discussions will be limited to performance considerations.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Working efficiently with large data sources</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This section will cover some basics of database tuning and ways to work efficiently with large data sources. Since <a/>the topic is more focused on data sources than on Tableau, no exercises are included.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you are connecting <a/>to large data sources and are experiencing performance problems, a conversation with a <strong class="keyWord">database administrator</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">DBA</strong>) may be beneficial.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Clear communication coupled with a small amount of database work could dramatically improve performance. The conversation should include database-tuning points, such as explicitly defining primary and foreign keys, defining columns as <em class="italic">not null</em>, and indexing. Each point will be discussed here.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Defining primary and foreign keys</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Primary and foreign keys are essential for joining tables. A primary key is composed of one or more columns <a/>in a table. The primary key should be <a/>unique for every row. Joining on <a/>a non-unique, row-level key may lead to erroneous results, as <a/>explored in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Learning about Joins, Blends, and Data Structures</em>. Explicitly defining primary keys in the database helps to ensure that each key value is unique:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_08.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.8: Database keys</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">A foreign key is composed of one or more columns in a table that uniquely identify rows in another table. This <a/>unique identification occurs as a <a/>result of the foreign key in one <a/>table referencing the primary key in another table. Explicitly <a/>defining foreign keys in the database enables Tableau to bypass many integrity checks, thereby improving performance.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Defining columns as NOT NULL</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau has <a/>published multiple white <a/>papers on performance improvement <a/>tips and tricks (<a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/performance_tips.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/performance_tips.htm</span></a>) that state that programmers and Tableau Desktop do not like <code class="inlineCode">NULL</code> data. Define each column in your tables with an explicit <code class="inlineCode">NOT NULL</code> if possible.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In practice, database admins debate when it is and isn’t appropriate to define columns as <code class="inlineCode">NOT NULL</code>; however, two things are clear:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">A primary or foreign key should be defined as <code class="inlineCode">NOT NULL</code>. This is self-evident since primary and foreign keys must be unique by definition.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Also, any column that is to be indexed should be defined as <code class="inlineCode">NOT NULL</code> since, otherwise, an index may be unusable.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Indexing is discussed more fully in the next section.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Indexing</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s consider the <a/>following two questions regarding indexing:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">What is an index?</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">What should be indexed?</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">The first of our two <a/>questions may be easily answered by a DBA but is likely uncharted waters for the average Tableau author. So, to clarify, an index is a copy of selected columns in a database table that has been optimized for efficient searching. Since these copied columns include pointers to the original columns, they can be accessed to quickly find given rows and return the required data.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">A small example may prove helpful. According to the Boeing Company, the 787 Dreamliner has about 2.3 million parts. Imagine a table that lists all these parts in the <strong class="keyWord">Part_Name</strong> column. Your task is to search this column for every part starting with the “fuse” string. On a non-indexed column, this would require the examination of every row of data in the database. Such a search could be quite slow. Fortunately, indexes can be used to reduce the number of rows searched, thus making the process much faster. One type of structured data used for indexing is B-tree. A B-tree data structure is sorted. Thus, when accessing an index using a B-tree data structure to search for all parts starting with <em class="italic">fuse</em>, not every row has to be considered. Instead, the database can skip straight to <em class="italic">fs</em> and quickly return the desired rows.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now let’s move on to the <a/>second question on indexing. What should be indexed? This question can be answered succinctly: ideally, all columns used for joining or filtering should be indexed in the data source.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Although there are some <a/>basic performance considerations for creating more efficient joins in Tableau (for example, avoid an outer join when a left join will suffice), join performance is largely determined outside of Tableau. Therefore, it is typically more important to index columns used in joins than those used for filtering.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To continue with our discussion of manipulating data sources, the next section will cover how Tableau can be used to create summarized datasets through extracting.</p>&#13;

<section id="ch13lvl1sec86">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Working with extracts</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">This section will discuss what a Tableau data extract is as well as how to efficiently construct an extract. A colleague <a/>of mine recently consulted with a relatively small mobile phone service provider. Even though the company was small, the volume could be in excess of 1,000,000 calls per day. Management at the company insisted on the ability to interface with detailed visualizations of individual calls in Tableau workbooks. The performance of the workbooks was, understandably, a problem. Was such low-level detail necessary? Might less detail and snappier workbooks have led to better business decisions?</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In order to balance business needs with practical performance requirements, businesses often need to ascertain what level of detail is genuinely helpful for reporting. Often, detailed granularity is not necessary. When such is the case, a summary table may provide sufficient business insight while enabling quick performance. In the case of the mobile phone service provider, a daily snapshot of call volumes may have sufficed. Even an hourly snapshot would have greatly reduced the table size and improved Tableau’s performance.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To address this common business need, an extract is a proprietary compressed data source created by Tableau Desktop. Since its release, the file extension for an extract has changed from <code class="inlineCode">.tde</code> to the <code class="inlineCode">.hyper</code> format. Thus, the new format makes use of the Hyper engine, which <a/>was discussed in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Reviewing the Basics</em>. An extract can be stored locally and accessed by Tableau to render visualizations.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Consider the following points that make an extract file an excellent choice for improved performance:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">Extracts can be quickly generated at an aggregate level.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Extracts are a columnar store, which records as sequences of columns.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Relational databases typically store data using a <strong class="keyWord">Row Store</strong> methodology.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">In the following example, note that <strong class="keyWord">Row Store</strong> is excellent for returning individual rows, whereas <strong class="keyWord">Column Store</strong> is much better for returning aggregated data.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Here is an example table:</p>&#13;

From the resulting dialog box, we can take the following actions:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Filter the extract as needed</strong>: Sometimes, an extract that precisely reflects a data source is warranted, but often filtering various fields will still populate the extract with the required data while shrinking the size and improving performance. To add a filter, simply click <strong class="keyWord">Add...</strong> to access a dialog box identical to the <strong class="keyWord">Filter</strong> dialog box used within a worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Aggregate to the level of granularity represented in the view</strong>: Aggregation not only reduces the file size but can also be helpful from a security standpoint. Without aggregation, an extract is constructed using row-level data. Therefore, the Tableau author should note that if the extract is built without choosing to aggregate, any sensitive row-level data is accessible:</li>&#13;
    </ul><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_09.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.9: Aggregation</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Reduce the number of rows</strong>: As shown in the <em class="italic">Small extracts</em> section, reducing the number of rows can allow the author to create a small, local extract for quick workbook building, after which the original data source can be accessed for complete analysis:</li>&#13;
    </ul><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_10.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.10: Reducing rows</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Hide all unused fields</strong>: This option excludes all columns that are not used in the workbook <a/>from the extract. This can significantly reduce the extract size and increase performance:</li>&#13;
    </ul><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_11.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.11: Hiding fields</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">By taking these four measures, your performance should improve immediately. Feel free to test it yourself by using the performance-recording tool and creating different extracts of the same data source. Using aggregation and performance-recording actions will be discussed next.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Aggregation</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The following <a/>exercise will use two aggregates from a single data source, one at the <strong class="keyWord">State</strong> level and the other at the <strong class="keyWord">City</strong> level. These aggregated data sources will be used to create two worksheets. Each of these worksheets will be placed on a dashboard along with a third worksheet with row-level information. Finally, filter actions will be created to tie the three worksheets together. The purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate how small extracts might be used in conjunction with a larger dataset to create a more performant dashboard:</p>&#13;

    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_16.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.16: Action on dashboard</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Having completed this exercise, note that the resulting dashboard is performant for the following reasons:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">When the user first opens the dashboard, only <strong class="keyWord">State Agg</strong> displays. This is performant for two reasons. First, displaying a single worksheet as opposed to every worksheet when opening the dashboard causes fewer initial queries and less rendering. Second, accessing a small extract is quicker than accessing a larger data source.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Since the <code class="inlineCode">City Agg</code> worksheet is also accessing a small extract, when the user clicks on a state, the <strong class="keyWord">City Agg</strong> worksheet will appear quickly.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">When the user clicks on <strong class="keyWord">City</strong>, a call is made to the data source that only includes the information for that city. A relatively small amount of data is pulled, and performance should be good for even larger datasets.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Another aspect of good performance practice, apart from using aggregate extracts, should be considered for this exercise. The dashboard contains no quick filters. Often, using quick filters on a dashboard is unnecessary. If the worksheets on the dashboard can be used to filter, those worksheets can essentially do double duty. That is to say, worksheets can provide valuable analysis while simultaneously acting as filters for other worksheets on the dashboard. This represents a performance improvement over using quick filters since adding quick filters would cause additional queries to be sent to the underlying data source.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the preceding dashboard, each worksheet references a different data source. Therefore, you may ask, how <a/>are the action filters able to function across the different data sources? The answer can be found in the filter action dialog box. As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.14 </em>and<em class="italic"> Figure 13.15</em>, <strong class="keyWord">All</strong> fields are considered <strong class="keyWord">Target Filters</strong>. Tableau simply matches any fields of the same name across each data source. Extracts can be optimized for even better performance results. We’ll cover this in the next section.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Optimizing extracts</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Optimization accelerates <a/>performance by materializing calculated fields when possible. This means that Tableau generates values for calculated fields in the extract so that those values can be looked up instead of calculated. If you were to use table calculations, Tableau would have to calculate the values each time you change the view.</p>&#13;
    <div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">Note that not all calculated fields are materialized. Fields that are not materialized include table calculations, changeable or unstable functions, such as <code class="inlineCode">NOW()</code> and <code class="inlineCode">TODAY()</code>, and calculated fields using parameters.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <p class="normal">When an extract is first created, it is automatically optimized. In other words, calculated fields are automatically materialized when possible. However, over the course of time, calculated fields may be altered that will cause the extract to drop materialized fields. At such times, open <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">[Data Source]</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Extract</strong> and click on <strong class="keyWord">Compute</strong> <strong class="keyWord">Calculations Now </strong>in order to regenerate the materialized fields:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_17.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.17: Computing calculations</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If an extract is set to refresh on Tableau Server, the extract is automatically optimized for each refresh.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Finally, if you make use of parameters in your dashboard, check whether you can eliminate those and use calculations instead to improve performance. Also, split calculations if they <a/>can’t be materialized as a whole. Put the part that can be materialized in one calculated field and the non-materialized part in another. If parts of the calculation can be calculated within the extract creation, you will gain performance.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The advantage of using extracts has now been discussed in great detail, so let’s move on and see how we can make the most out of filters.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section id="ch13lvl1sec87">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Using filters wisely</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Filters generally improve <a/>performance in Tableau. For example, when using a dimension filter to view only the West region, a query is passed to the underlying data source, resulting in information being returned for just that region. By reducing the amount of data returned, performance improves. This is because less data means reduced network bandwidth load, reduced database processing requirements, and reduced processing requirements for the local computer.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Filters can also negatively impact Tableau’s performance. For example, using <strong class="keyWord">only relevant values</strong> causes additional queries to be sent to the underlying data source, thereby slowing down the <a/>response time. Also, creating quick filters from high-cardinality dimensions can impair performance.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau’s filters are executed in a specific order, so keep this in mind when using them. The following flowchart, along with a link to an hour-long presentation, may help you grasp the concept fully: <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/order_of_operations.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/order_of_operations.htm</span></a>:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_18.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.18: Filtering the order of operations</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The rest of this section follows, step by step, the order of operations. By the end of it, you will know which filters to use in which situation so as to achieve the best performance for your dashboards.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Extract filters</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Extract filters remove data <a/>from the extracted data source. Simply put, the <a/>data isn’t there. Thus, performance is enhanced by reducing the overall amount of data. Performance may also be improved since extracted data uses Tableau’s proprietary columnar dataset.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Furthermore, extracts are <a/>always flattened, which will have performance advantages <a/>over connecting to datasets using joins. To create an extract filter, begin by selecting <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">[Data Source]</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Extract Data</strong>. In the resulting dialog box, choose to add a filter.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Data source filters</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Data source filters are applied <a/>throughout the workbook. For <a/>example, if you create a data source filter that removes all members of the <strong class="keyWord">Country</strong> dimension except the USA, the <strong class="keyWord">Country</strong> dimension will only include the USA for all worksheets in the workbook.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Data source filters improve performance in the same way as dimension and measure filters; that is, data source filters cause Tableau to generate a query to the underlying data source, which will limit the data that is returned. Less returned data generally results in quicker processing and rendering. A further advantage that data source filters offer is ease of authoring. For example, if the Tableau author knows in advance that an entire workbook is going to be USA-centric, creating a data source filter saves you the trouble of applying a dimension filter to every worksheet in the workbook using that data source.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Also note that data source filters occur quite early in the process flow. All calculations (including calculations using fixed LOD expressions that are rendered before dimension and measure filters are triggered) respect data source filters.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To create a data source filter, click the <strong class="keyWord">Data Source</strong> tab located in the bottom-left corner of <strong class="keyWord">Tableau Desktop</strong>. Then, click on the <strong class="keyWord">Add</strong> link located in the top-right corner of the page:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_19.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.19: Adding filters</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Context filters</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">A context filter is created <a/>simply by right-clicking on a field in the <strong class="keyWord">Filter</strong> shelf and <a/>selecting <strong class="keyWord">Add to Context</strong>:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_20.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.20: Context filters</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Dimension and measure filters are independent. Each filter queries the data source independently and returns results. A context filter, on the other hand, will force dimension and measure filters to depend on it. This behavior can be helpful (and necessary) for getting the right answer in some circumstances. For instance, if a Tableau author accesses the <strong class="keyWord">Superstore</strong> dataset and uses a filter on <strong class="keyWord">Product Names</strong> to return the top-10 selling <a/>product names in a single category, it will be necessary for <strong class="keyWord">Category</strong> to be <a/>defined as a context filter. Otherwise, the <strong class="keyWord">Product Names</strong> filter will return the top 10 overall. Because of this, context filters improve performance.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Dimension and measure filters</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Dimension and measure filters can improve performance. Since either a dimension filter or a measure filter will <a/>cause Tableau to generate a query to the underlying data <a/>source, which will limit the data that is returned, performance <a/>is improved. Simply put, the smaller the returned <a/>dataset, the better the performance.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">However, dimension and measure filters can degrade performance. Since Tableau not only generates queries to the underlying data source in order to display visualizations but also generates queries to display filters, more displayed filters will slow performance. Furthermore, displayed filters on high-cardinality dimensions can inhibit performance. (A dimension with many members is referred to as having high cardinality.) Consider the example of a filter that displays every customer in a dataset. Performance for such a filter might be slow because every customer in the underlying dataset must be located and returned, and then Tableau has to render and display each of these customers in the filter.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">When using two or more dimension or measure filters on a view, a relevant filter may be used to limit the choices that display. For example, if a view includes a filter for city and postal code, the latter might be set to show <strong class="keyWord">Only Relevant Values</strong>:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_21.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.21: Only Relevant Values</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This is advantageous to the end user in that it adjusts the number of postal codes that display to reflect <a/>only those pertinent to the cities selected in the first <a/>filter. However, using relative filters will cause additional <a/>queries to be <a/>sent to the data source and thus may degrade performance.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Table calculation filters</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Using table calculations as filters does not have the same corresponding performance enhancements as <a/>dimension or measure filters. As discussed above, dimension <a/>and measure filters reduce the returned dataset, while table calculation filters do not. In the Tableau process flow, table calculations are not rendered until after the data is returned from the data source. This means that table calculations cannot be used to generate queries to limit returned data. Or, to put it another way, table calculation filters cause all data related to a given dimension or measure to be returned, after which Tableau executes the filter on the returned dataset.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To demonstrate this, perform the following steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the workbook associated with this chapter and navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Late Filter</code> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane, select the <code class="inlineCode">Superstore</code> data source.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Create a calculated field named <code class="inlineCode">Cust Name Tbl Calc</code> with the following code:&#13;
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">LOOKUP( <span class="hljs-built_in">MAX</span>( [Customer Name] ),<span class="hljs-number">0</span> )&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;
      </li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Place <strong class="keyWord">Customer Name</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Rows</strong> shelf.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Place <strong class="keyWord">Cust Name Tbl Calc</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Filters</strong> shelf and constrain to show only <strong class="keyWord">Aaron Bergman</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Place <strong class="keyWord">Sales</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Text</strong> shelf.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Right-click on <strong class="keyWord">Sales</strong> and select <strong class="keyWord">Quick Table Calculation</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Rank</strong>.</li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">In this exercise, the entire list of customers is returned to Tableau, after which Tableau deploys the filter. Essentially, using <strong class="keyWord">Cust Name Tbl Calc</strong> as a filter merely hides the underlying data. This is useful because the rank returned for <strong class="keyWord">Aaron Bergman</strong> is correct. Merely filtering on <strong class="keyWord">Customer Name</strong> would return a rank of <strong class="keyWord">1</strong> for <strong class="keyWord">Aaron Bergman</strong>. Unfortunately, the <a/>correct results come with a performance hit. Running <a/>the performance recorder on this exercise will show that the table calculation negatively impacts performance.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Fortunately, with the advent of LOD calculations, using table calculations as filters is often not necessary. LODs are calculated fields that include or exclude data independent of the current view. For more information, please refer to <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Introducing Table Calculations</em>.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Using actions instead of filters</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Another way to improve performance might be to use actions instead of filters. You can develop a <a/>dashboard that shows a high-level overview first <a/>and goes into detail only once the user selects something. The mechanics are similar to the ones we showed in the <em class="italic">Aggregation</em> section; however, aggregation happens per worksheet and not on the data source itself. By selecting a mark in the high-level overview, an action will be triggered. The user can dive deeper into details, but the level of detail will only be increased step by step. Hence, less data has to be loaded at once.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">A very nice presentation regarding this topic can be found at <a href="https://youtu.be/veLlZ1btoms" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://youtu.be/veLlZ1btoms</span></a>.

    <table class="table-container"><tbody><tr><td class="table-cell">&#13;

This section will explore what to do and what to avoid when creating calculated fields in order to maximize performance.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Prioritizing code values</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Calculations that use Boolean values or numbers are more performant than those that use dates. Calculations <a/>that use dates, in turn, are more <a/>performant than those using strings. This is not only true of Tableau, but also in computer science as a whole.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Based on this information, <strong class="keyWord">Scenario II</strong> listed in the preceding table is more performant than <strong class="keyWord">Scenario I</strong>. <strong class="keyWord">Scenario I</strong> causes Tableau to create a query that requires the data source engine to handle strings for reporting profitability, whereas <strong class="keyWord">Scenario II</strong> sends only 1s and 0s to determine profitability. The third step for <strong class="keyWord">Scenario II</strong> (that is, aliasing <strong class="keyWord">True</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">False</strong> to <strong class="keyWord">Profitable</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Unprofitable</strong>) is merely a labeling change that happens after the aggregate dataset is returned from the data source, which is quick and easy for Tableau.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Level-of-detail calculations or table calculations</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In some instances, a <strong class="keyWord">level-of-detail</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">LOD</strong>) calculation might be faster than a table calculation and <a/>vice versa. If you are not <a/>sure, try both to see which one performs better. You can, of course, run a performance recording too. Also, if they’re not really needed, use neither. Refer to the following diagram, which explains when to choose which:</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Other ways to improve performance</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">To conclude this chapter, let’s consider a few other possibilities for improving performance.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Avoid overcrowding a dashboard</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Often, end users want to see everything at once on a dashboard. Although this may be perceived as <a/>beneficial, it often is not. Consider the inclusion of a large crosstab on a dashboard. Does scrolling through pages of details add to the analytical value of the dashboard? Perhaps the answer is “no.” Furthermore, an excess of information on a dashboard may obscure important insights. Diplomatically arguing for leaner dashboards may lead to better decision making as well as better performance.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Fixing dashboard sizing</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Dashboards can be set to an exact size or to <strong class="keyWord">Range</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">Automatic</strong>. Exact size results in quicker performance because once Tableau Server has rendered a view for one end user, that render stays in the cache and can be reused for the next end user that accesses that dashboard. <strong class="keyWord">Automatic</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">Range</strong>, on the other hand, cause Tableau Server to attempt to determine the resolution size used by each end user and render the dashboard accordingly. This means that Tableau Server does not use the instance of the dashboard stored in the cache for the next end user. This, in turn, impacts performance.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Use Tableau Prep Builder</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This has been mentioned before but is very relevant, therefore I will repeat: <strong class="keyWord">If complex joins and complex data blending are required to generate useful results, it may be advisable to perform ETL work outside of Tableau</strong>, for example, in Tableau Prep Builder (see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Using Tableau Prep Builder</em>, for more information on this service). ETL work will ideally lead to better data modeling, aggregated data, or data that contains additional columns already that you would otherwise have to create in Tableau Desktop, and thus using Prep Builder leads to easier authoring and quicker performance in Tableau.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Setting expectations</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If an end user is expecting near-instantaneous performance, then, of course, anything less is disappointing. Explaining in advance that a complicated, detail-oriented dashboard may not be performant can help in at least two ways. First, upon explaining the likely performance problems, a compromise may be reached that results in the creation of a less complicated dashboard that still delivers valuable information. Second, if it is absolutely necessary for the dashboard to be complicated and detail-oriented, at least the end user has been warned that patience may be needed when interfacing it.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Workbook Optimizer</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Finally, for the lazy ones among us – or one might say – efficient ones, Tableau released a fantastic feature not that long ago: the Workbook Optimizer. It checks your workbook based on a set of rules and will respond with three types of categories: take action, needs review, and passed. Thus, it completes performance checks using the well-known RAG (red-amber-green) or traffic light system for you. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">At the time of writing, rules include: calculation length, calculation using multiple data sources, dashboard size not fixed, filter uses <a/>conditional logic, filter uses “only relevant values,” live data connections, multiple connections in a data source, nested calculations, non-materialized calculations, number of data sources, number of filters, number of layout containers, number of LOD calculations, number of views in a dashboard, number of workbook sheets, unused data sources, unused fields, uses data blending, uses date calculations, and uses grouping. I am sure, however, there are more rules to come and it will become increasingly easy to have a high-performing dashboard. You can access the Workbook Optimizer feature by selecting <strong class="screenText">Server</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Run Optimizer</strong>:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_13_23.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.23: Run Optimizer</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You will then be able to drill down per category and see where your dashboard needs improvement. For most of the rules, some human intervention is required but for some, a click of a button is <a/>sufficient, like in <em class="italic">Figure 13.24</em>. Observe the icons below the rule – the wrench indicates that Tableau can fix this for you.</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">For each rule, Tableau also provides a <strong class="keyWord">Learn More</strong> hyperlink that will redirect you to one of the Tableau help pages with further explanation.</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">Isn’t this feature amazing?! From <a/>now on, always make sure to use the <strong class="keyWord">Run Optimizer</strong> button!</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Summary</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">We began this chapter with a discussion of the performance-recording dashboard. This was important because many of the subsequent exercises utilized the performance-recording dashboard to examine underlying queries. Next, we discussed hardware and on-the-fly techniques, where the intent was to communicate hardware considerations for good Tableau performance and, in the absence of optimal hardware, techniques for squeezing the best possible performance out of any computer.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Then we covered working with data sources, including joining, blending, and efficiently working with data sources. This was followed by a discussion on generating and using extracts as efficiently as possible. By focusing on data sources for these three sections, we learned best practices and what to avoid when working with either remote datasets or extracts. The next sections explored performance implications for various types of filters and calculations. Lastly, we looked at additional performance considerations, where we explored a few more thoughts regarding dashboard performance as well as setting expectations.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will turn our attention to Tableau Server. Tableau Server is a dense topic worthy of its own book; therefore, our exploration will be truncated to only focus on Tableau Server from the Tableau Desktop author’s perspective.</p>&#13;
