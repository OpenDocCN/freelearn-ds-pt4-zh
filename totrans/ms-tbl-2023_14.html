<h1 class="chapterTitle">Exploring Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud are online solutions for sharing, distributing, and collaborating on content created in Tableau Desktop and/or Tableau Public. Its benefits include providing an environment where end users can securely view, explore, and refresh both real-time and scheduled data visualizations. The main difference between Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud is that Tableau Server needs to be maintained by you, while Tableau Cloud is fully hosted in the cloud by Tableau and backed up by Amazon Web Services infrastructure. For ease of reading, we will further refer to both as Tableau Server.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The scope of this chapter is limited to the Tableau Desktop author’s interaction with Tableau Server. Topics such as installation and upgrades, authentication and access, security configuration, and command-line utilities are not related to the Tableau Desktop author’s interaction with Tableau Server and are thus not included in this chapter. However, the help documentation is quite good. Also consider watching some videos from Tableau Software about Tableau Server (for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/tableausoftware/search?query=Tableau%20Server" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.youtube.com/c/tableausoftware/search?query=Tableau%20Server</span></a>). If you have questions related to any of the topics listed here or regarding any other Tableau Server topics, be sure to visit the online help site at <a href="https://www.tableau.com/support/help" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.tableau.com/support/help</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This chapter will explore the following topics:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">Publishing a data source to Tableau Server</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Web authoring</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Maintaining workbooks on Tableau Server</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">More Tableau Server settings and features</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Tableau Server is a fantastic way to take your company’s Tableau adoption to the next level. The most important question on your mind is probably, how can you bring your Tableau dashboards from Desktop to Server? That is exactly what we are going to show you in the first section.</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">Publishing a data source to Tableau Server</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">So, you purchased Tableau Desktop, became<a/> a pro dashboard<a/> developer, and now you want to share your work with your colleagues. Do they all need a Tableau Desktop license and installation to see your visualizations? Luckily, the answer is: NO! The best way to share Tableau dashboards is on Tableau Server. This way, your colleagues only need a Tableau Server viewing license, which is much cheaper than the developer license, and they can fully interact with the dashboard you built and uploaded to Server. A detailed description of the different<a/> roles in Tableau Server license models can be found here: <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/license_manage.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/license_manage.htm</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">This chapter assumes the reader has access to Tableau Server with sufficient privileges to publish data sources and edit in the web authoring environment. If you do not have access to Tableau Server but would like to work through the exercises in this chapter, consider downloading the trial version, which, as of the time of writing, provides full functionality for two weeks.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <p class="normal">But how do you upload your dashboard from Desktop to Server? Let us look at the following steps to see how we can publish a data source to Tableau Server:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Navigate to <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/marleen.meier" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://public.tableau.com/profile/marleen.meier</span></a> to locate and download the workbook associated with this chapter.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">Publish</code> worksheet.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Make sure the data source is <code class="inlineCode">My Superstore</code>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">If you have not already done so, log in to your instance of <strong class="keyWord">Tableau Server</strong> by clicking on <strong class="screenText">Server</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Sign In…</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_01.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.1: Server—Sign In…</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="5">In the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane, select<a/> the <code class="inlineCode">My Superstore</code> data<a/> source.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="screenText">Server</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Publish Data Source</strong> | <strong class="screenText">My Superstore</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_02.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.2: Server—Publish Data Source</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="7">In the resulting dialog box, input your desired settings.</li>&#13;
    </ol><p class="normal">If you have different projects on your Tableau Server, you can choose which project to publish the data source to. You can also change the name if you like or add a description, which comes in handy, especially if you have lots of different data sources and you want to allow your users to look for the one they need. By adding tags, you will add a metadata layer that will allow your Tableau Server users to search for a given data source based on tags. You can also change the permissions. Your setup might be that different users are in different groups, so here you can select which group is allowed which permissions. And lastly, you can immediately<a/> upload the workbook with the data source<a/> such that both are available on Tableau Server.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Tableau file types</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We will continue<a/> our discussion of Tableau Server by considering the various Tableau file types. This may seem a surprising place to continue but as you read, you will discover that a clear understanding of file types provides the Tableau Desktop author with foundational knowledge for efficiently and effectively interacting with Tableau Server.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The file types discussed previously that are relevant for understanding how to interact with Tableau Server are considered in some depth. The file types that are not relevant for understanding Tableau Server are considered only briefly. Some file types (for example, those associated with license activation) are not considered.</p>&#13;
    <h3 class="heading-3">Tableau data source</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let us now look at the various data sources<a/> available in Tableau. Look at the following Tableau data file:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">File format type</strong>: XML.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">What it contains</strong>: Metadata.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Why it’s useful</strong>: The <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file is important because it allows the Tableau author to define default formatting and aggregation, calculated fields, data types, field types, and more. Furthermore, the <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file can be published to Tableau Server and thus accessed by other authors in the environment. This effectively makes a <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file a playbook, which ensures consistency across the organization. This important feature will be explored more fully in the <em class="italic">Tableau Server architecture</em> section.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">How it’s generated</strong>: A <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file can be generated by right-clicking on a data source in the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane and selecting <strong class="keyWord">Add to Saved Data Sources...</strong>, followed by selecting <strong class="keyWord">Tableau Data Source</strong> in the resulting dialog box. A <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file can also be generated when publishing to Tableau Server via <strong class="keyWord">Server</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Publish Data Source</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">[data source]</strong>. The <em class="italic">Publishing a data source to Tableau Server</em> section demonstrates how to publish a <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file and also a <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> file.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">How to access it</strong>: The <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file type is usually accessed in one of two places. First, it can be stored in <strong class="keyWord">My Tableau Repository</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Datasources</strong>. When stored in this directory, a <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file will display in the left portion of the <strong class="keyWord">Start </strong>page under the <strong class="keyWord">Saved Data Sources</strong> section. The second place a <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file is often stored is on Tableau Server. Navigating to<strong class="keyWord"> Data</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">New Data Source</strong> and choosing <strong class="keyWord">Tableau Server</strong> allows the Tableau author to point to the <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> and <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> files that have been<a/> published to Tableau Server.</li>&#13;
    </ul><h3 class="heading-3">Tableau packaged data source</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Look at the following<a/> Tableau data file details:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">File format type</strong>: Compressed.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">What it contains</strong>: Metadata and a data extract.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Why it is useful</strong>: The <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> file is useful because it can be accessed for both metadata and data. Tableau authors can access a <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> file located on Tableau Server as a data source, thus eliminating the need for a workbook to connect directly to an external data source. A published <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> file can be placed on a schedule so that it is regularly updated from the underlying data source.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">How it is generated</strong>: A <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> file can be generated by right-clicking on a data source in the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane and selecting <strong class="keyWord">Add to Saved Data Sources...</strong>, followed by selecting <strong class="keyWord">Tableau Packaged Data Source</strong> in the resulting dialog box. Like the <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file, the <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> file can also be generated when publishing to Tableau Server via <strong class="keyWord">Server</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Publish Data Source</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">[data source]</strong>. See the next exercise section for more details.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">How to access it</strong>: A <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> file is accessed in the same way a <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> file is. First, it can be stored in <strong class="keyWord">My Tableau Repository</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Datasources</strong>. When stored in this directory, a <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> file will display in the left portion of the <strong class="keyWord">Start Page </strong>under the <strong class="keyWord">Saved Data Sources</strong> section. The second place a <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> file is often stored is on Tableau Server. Selecting<strong class="keyWord"> Data</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">New Data Source</strong> and choosing <strong class="keyWord">Tableau Server</strong> allows the Tableau author to point to the <code class="inlineCode">.tds</code> and <code class="inlineCode">.tdsx</code> files that have been published to a given instance of Tableau Server.</li>&#13;
    </ul><h3 class="heading-3">Tableau workbook</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Next to data sources, we have<a/> Tableau workbooks. Take a look at the following Tableau data file details:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">File format type</strong>: XML.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">What it contains</strong>: Metadata and schema. The schema defines the visualizations in the workbook. Note that schema, in this context, refers to the XML that defines the visual components of the workbook, including the visualizations displayed on worksheets as well as the layout of dashboards and stories.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Why it is useful</strong>: The <code class="inlineCode">.twb</code> file type is the file type most often used by the Tableau author. It is necessary for creating visualizations that point to a live dataset. Thus, real-time solutions will utilize this file type.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">How it is generated</strong>: A <code class="inlineCode">.twb</code> file is created via <strong class="keyWord">File </strong>| <strong class="keyWord">Save As</strong>, then by selecting the <code class="inlineCode">.twb</code> file type in the resulting dialog box.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">How to access it</strong>: A <code class="inlineCode">.twb</code> file can be opened via Tableau Desktop or accessed via a browser that points to an instance of Tableau Server. Since a <code class="inlineCode">.twb</code> file is XML, it can be opened, viewed, and updated via a text editor.</li>&#13;
    </ul><h3 class="heading-3">Tableau packaged workbook</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Look at the following<a/> Tableau data file details:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">File format type</strong>: Compressed.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">What it contains</strong>: Metadata, schema, and optionally, one or more data extracts.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Why it’s useful</strong>: The <code class="inlineCode">.twbx</code> file type is required for use with Tableau Reader. It can also be effectively used with Tableau Server when accessing data sources to which Tableau Server does not directly connect, such as flat files and Microsoft Excel and Access files. Drawbacks to the <code class="inlineCode">.twbx</code> file will be discussed next.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">How it’s generated</strong>: A <code class="inlineCode">.twbx</code> file is created via <strong class="keyWord">File</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Save As</strong>, then by selecting the <code class="inlineCode">.twbx</code> file type in the resulting dialog box.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">How to access it</strong>: A <code class="inlineCode">.twbx</code> file can be opened via Tableau Desktop or accessed via a browser that points to an instance of Tableau Server. Since a <code class="inlineCode">.twbx</code> file is a compressed file, it can also be unzipped via a compression utility, such as WinZip or 7-Zip.</li>&#13;
    </ul><h3 class="heading-3">Other file types</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The remaining file types you should be familiar with are not particularly relevant to Tableau Server and will thus only be briefly discussed here. There might be some issues with the compatibility of Tableau Desktop extracts and Tableau Server versions. A full list of compatibility<a/> scenarios can be found at <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/desktopdeploy/en-us/desktop_deploy_compatibility.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/desktopdeploy/en-us/desktop_deploy_compatibility.htm</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s take a look at the following other file types:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tableau Data Extract</strong>: The <code class="inlineCode">.hyper</code> file can be generated<a/> via the following: if a <code class="inlineCode">.twb</code> file is opened in Tableau Desktop, a <code class="inlineCode">.hyper</code> file can be created by right-clicking on a data source in the <strong class="keyWord">Data</strong> pane and selecting <strong class="keyWord">Extract Data</strong>. After selecting the desired options, Tableau will provide a dialog box for the author to save the file in a given location. The extract file can be used to create a local snapshot of a data source for a quicker authoring experience. That same local snapshot is also portable and can thus be used offline.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tableau Bookmark</strong>: The <code class="inlineCode">.tbm</code> file can be generated via <strong class="keyWord">Window</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Bookmark </strong>| <strong class="keyWord">Create Bookmark</strong>. It can be useful<a/> for duplicating worksheets across multiple workbooks and also for sharing formatting across multiple workbooks.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tableau Map Source</strong>: In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Working with Maps, </em>we discussed the use of Mapbox and WMS; if you would<a/> save these dashboards, you could do so in<em class="italic"> </em><code class="inlineCode">.tms</code><em class="italic"> </em>format.</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tableau Preferences Source</strong>: The <code class="inlineCode">.tps</code> file can be used to create custom color palettes. This can be helpful<a/> when an organization wishes to use its color scheme within Tableau workbooks. The <code class="inlineCode">.tps</code> file that Tableau utilizes is called <code class="inlineCode">Preferences.tps</code> and is located in the <code class="inlineCode">My Tableau Repository</code>. Since it’s an XML format, it can be altered via a text editor. Matt Francis has posted a helpful blog at <a href="https://wannabedatarockstar.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://wannabedatarockstar.blogspot.com/</span></a> that clearly communicates how to adjust this file. You can also reference the Tableau help page.</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">Now that we’ve discussed the different file types, let’s talk about web authoring.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section id="ch14lvl1sec93">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Web authoring</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">After you have published<a/> a dashboard to Tableau Server, how do you go about editing it? Well, Tableau offers two options. In the first option, both you and everyone else who has access and the rights to download the dashboard can download it, edit it in Tableau Desktop, and overwrite the latest version on Tableau Server with a new upload. The other option is to edit the dashboard live on Server. This feature is called <strong class="keyWord">web authoring</strong>. Web authoring is a Tableau Server feature that provides an interface for authoring that is similar to Tableau Desktop. Originally, the web authoring interface was limited, but more features are introduced with each version. Thus, the capability gap between the Tableau Server web authoring environment and Tableau Desktop has shrunk. The web authoring environment provides robust capabilities for creating and applying table calculations and provides capabilities for creating dashboards.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">As of the time of writing, some features are still missing altogether in the Tableau Server web authoring environment, but the following link will give you an overview of what is out there, comparing<a/> Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server web authoring functionality: <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/server_desktop_web_edit_differences.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/server_desktop_web_edit_differences.htm</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Next, two very brief exercises will demonstrate how to access the authoring environment within Tableau Server. Keep in mind that the Tableau Server admin needs to grant the respective rights to users to do so.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Editing an existing workbook with web authoring</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s perform the following steps<a/> to edit an existing workbook<a/> on Tableau Server:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Log in to an instance of Tableau Server.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select the <code class="inlineCode">My Superstore</code> data source that we uploaded in the <em class="italic">Publishing a data source to Tableau Server</em> section.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="screenText">New, Workbook</strong> to create a workbook based on the published data source:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_03.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.3: Published data source</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="4">Drag <strong class="screenText">Category</strong> on to <strong class="screenText">Columns</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Profit</strong> on to <strong class="screenText">Rows</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Now click<a/> on <strong class="screenText">File</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Publish As…</strong> and in the popup, choose a name<a/> for the workbook (I called mine <code class="inlineCode">Test</code>), and hit <strong class="keyWord">Publish</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_04.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.4: Publish Workbook</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="6">If you go back now to the default folder of Tableau Server, you will see an additional workbook called <strong class="screenText">Test</strong>, next to the <strong class="screenText">My Superstore</strong> published data source:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_05.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.5: Workbook view</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="7">If you want to continue<a/> editing the <code class="inlineCode">Test</code> workbook, simply<a/> open it on Tableau Server and select the <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong> button:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_06.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.6: Web authoring</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This is as easy as it gets.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">So far, we have published<a/> a dataset, built a workbook from that dataset<a/> on Tableau Server, and perhaps you even edited the workbook. If not yet, no worries, we will do so in the next exercise.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Understanding the Tableau Server web authoring environment</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let’s perform the following steps to understand<a/> the Tableau Server web authoring environment:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Access the workbook associated with this chapter and note the <code class="inlineCode">Sales &amp; Quota</code> worksheet:</li>&#13;

    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="5">From here, you should<a/> see an interface similar to the one you are used to from Tableau Desktop. This is what web authoring is all about—you have most of the Tableau Desktop functionality online and you don’t even need to open Tableau Desktop as long as your workbook has been published to Tableau Server. Let’s try it!</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">The first thing you might notice is that even though we didn’t publish the <code class="inlineCode">Cover</code> or <code class="inlineCode">Publish</code> sheet, it is visible in the web authoring view. You can right-click on either one to make this worksheet accessible for Tableau Server users that don’t have access to web authoring by selecting <strong class="screenText">Publish</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_11.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.11: Web authoring</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="7">Next, on the <code class="inlineCode">Sales &amp; Quota</code> tab, press the <em class="keystroke">Ctrl</em> (Windows) or <em class="keystroke">Command</em> (macOS) button<a/> on your keyboard and, while doing so, drag the <strong class="screenText">Quota Met?</strong> field to the <strong class="screenText">Rows</strong> shelf:</li>&#13;

    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="8">You will see that crosses and checkmarks appear in the view. This shows us that we can not only use a color to indicate whether we met a quota but also a mark in the view with this simple calculated field: <code class="inlineCode">IF SUM([Sales]) &gt;= [Quota] THEN "</code><img src="../images/B18435_14_001.png" alt=""/><code class="inlineCode">" ELSE "</code><img src="../images/B18435_14_002.png" alt=""/><code class="inlineCode">" END</code>.

<h1 class="heading-1">Maintaining workbooks on Tableau Server</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">We have talked about the dashboard<a/> editing options<a/> and auto-save, but we have not yet discussed how we can keep track of changes and make sure that we don’t lose important information in the process of producing new information. This section will provide help on how to maintain workbooks on Tableau Server, starting with revision history.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Revision history</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You, as a Tableau dashboard<a/> developer or even a Tableau Server admin, want to make sure that your users are always looking at the right data. But then this happens: you edit a dashboard and after your edit, the dashboard displays faulty information. A user calls you and wants the old dashboard back immediately. What do you do? Use revision history!</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau Server ships with a revision history that ensures that the past 25 versions of each workbook and data source are retrievable. This setting can be enabled or disabled by the Tableau Server admin. In Tableau Desktop, if you attempt to upload a workbook or data source<a/> with the same name as a previously uploaded file, Tableau Desktop will display a warning such as <strong class="keyWord">Workbook name is already in use</strong>:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_13.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.13: Overwriting data source</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Publishing will overwrite the existing data source. If you proceed with the upload, revision control will be activated, and the previous version of the file will remain accessible as a revision. To access the revision history for individual workbooks and data sources in Tableau Server, simply select<strong class="keyWord"> </strong>any data source or workbook you uploaded and click on the three dots at the bottom right. In the popup, select <strong class="screenText">Revision History...</strong>:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_14.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.14: Revision History...</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This will open a dialog box<a/> where you can choose which previous version to restore:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_15.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.15: Revision History II</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Revision histories are so helpful! I hope you will not have to use them often but it’s always good to have options. The next question many organizations have is, how can I make sure that users only see what they are supposed to see and not just everything that has been published to Tableau Server? One solution<a/> is user filters. We will discuss this topic next!</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">User filters</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Students often ask me something<a/> along the lines of the following question: I have sales managers over various territories. It’s important that the sales managers see only their metrics; that is, not the metrics of the other sales managers. In order to accomplish this, do I have to create separate workbooks for each sales manager?</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Fortunately, the answer is no. Tableau provides user filters that allow the Tableau author to make sure that each of those sales managers sees only the information for which they have clearance. To demonstrate this, take the following steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">This exercise needs more than one user on Tableau Server. Therefore, go ahead and create at least one additional user on Tableau Server by clicking on <strong class="screenText">Users</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Add Users</strong>. I used a second email address that I own to do so:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_16.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.16: Add Users</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="2">As an optional step, you<a/> can change an account’s display name. To change<a/> the display name of an account, log in to <a href="https://www.tableau.com/" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.tableau.com/</span></a>, click on <strong class="keyWord">User</strong> | <strong class="keyWord">Edit Account</strong>, and make the desired changes to the first and last name entries.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">As a second optional step, instead of assigning single users to a filter, you can also assign groups of users. To do so, you can create different groups, as follows:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_17.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.17: Add Group</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="4">You can then split the users<a/> on your Tableau Server instance into <strong class="screenText">Central</strong>,<strong class="keyWord"> </strong><strong class="screenText">East</strong>,<strong class="keyWord"> </strong><strong class="screenText">South</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">West</strong><strong class="keyWord"> </strong>regions by selecting a user and then <strong class="screenText">Group Membership…</strong> under <strong class="screenText">Actions</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_18.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.18: Add Group II</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="5">Now, access the workbook associated with this chapter and navigate to the <code class="inlineCode">View Level User Filter</code> worksheet. Note that the view is a field map of the USA with <strong class="keyWord">State</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Detail</strong> shelf, <strong class="keyWord">Region</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Color</strong> shelf, and <strong class="keyWord">Sales</strong> on the <strong class="keyWord">Label</strong> shelf.</li>&#13;

    </ol><p class="normal">Once the workbook is published to Tableau Server, users who access the workbook will only see the information the filter allows. This can also be applied to saved data sources at the data source level.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">One important thing to note is, as opposed to simply adding a dimension filter to the <strong class="keyWord">Filters</strong> shelf, you might want to consider adding the <strong class="keyWord">Sales Region</strong> to the <strong class="keyWord">Data Source</strong> filter. This is important because any user with web authoring permission can simply remove a filter from the <strong class="keyWord">Filters</strong> shelf. In the case of this exercise, the user would then be able to see metrics for every region. Data source filters, however, cannot be removed via the web authoring environment and are thus more secure. Furthermore, a data source filter is workbook-wide, which further secures the data. However, if you don’t have web authoring<a/> enabled, the <strong class="keyWord">Filters</strong> shelf serves its purpose.</p>&#13;
    <div class="note">&#13;

<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">More Tableau Server settings and features</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Once a dashboard has been published, users can set alerts, certify data sources, subscribe, add comments to a dashboard, and more, depending on their permissions. This section will address the different functionalities in two different places: on a worksheet and on a view. Next to those, Tableau Server has many more functionalities, especially settings for site admins, which are—unfortunately—out of the scope of this book.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Features on the worksheet level</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">By <em class="italic">features on the worksheet level</em>, I mean the settings<a/> that are available to you after selecting a project and a certain worksheet like so:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_23.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.23: Tableau Server</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">On this level, we see eight different tabs, which we will discuss over the next few pages.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Views</strong>: Views show a thumbnail of all the worksheets<a/> or dashboards that have been published within one workbook. When uploading a workbook to Tableau Server, you can select all the views that should show here:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_24.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.24: Publish Workbook</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">By clicking on the three dots next to a View, more options will show, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_25.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.25: Options</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The different options are self-explanatory: you can edit the view (also referred to as web authoring, which we’ve discussed earlier in the chapter), and you can share the view with other users, where Tableau will send an email with an image and a hyperlink to the user you shared the view with. You can also add tags that will help other users find the view, you can check which user or group has permission to open the view and who has seen this view, and lastly, you can delete it. Which of those options will display is a matter of the configuration in Tableau Server, so your admin can enable or disable the different features to show or else<a/> they might be grayed out.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Data Sources</strong>: The next tab is <strong class="screenText">Data Sources</strong>. It will give you an overview<a/> of the data sources used to create this workbook:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_26.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><figure class="mediaobject">Figure 14.26: Data Sources</figure><p class="normal">You will be able to see which type of data sources<a/> were used; for example, with an extract of live connections, by clicking on the three dots by each source, you will again be able to see more settings, depending on the settings of your Tableau Server:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_27.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.27: Data Sources II</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Connected Metrics</strong>: Next in line are the connected<a/> metrics. This is a relatively new feature. To see metrics, you first have to set them up in a view. We will get to this in the second part of this section, but basically, it allows you to select pieces of different dashboards and views and combine those data points as metrics to monitor your data. Metrics make use of a specific data mark in your view. Therefore, you might need to adjust your view to show the one mark you want to use.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">For example, if you have a dashboard with daily profits over the past year but your metrics should show only the last profit data point, you will have to create a new view in order to use the explicit last profit in a metric, even though the data is already part of the initial view. However, a big advantage is that you don’t need to connect to different data sources, as the connections that are already set up in the different workbooks will be leveraged.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">More details regarding metrics can be found here: <a href="https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2020/5/introducing-metrics-headlines-your-data" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2020/5/introducing-metrics-headlines-your-data</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Extract Refreshes</strong>: When using extracts as the data<a/> source, you can define a refresh schedule while uploading the workbook to Tableau Server or even after you published the workbook. The different schedules can be set by your server admin. If you set the extract refresh to run at 7 AM every day, for example, Tableau Server will access the data source, perhaps a SQL database, at 7 AM, and load the data, and you will in return see the latest data in your Tableau dashboard. Using extracts tends to perform better than a live connection, depending on the amount of data and the type of data source, but be aware that the data in the dashboard will always be as old as your latest extract.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Subscriptions</strong>: Subscriptions can be set on a view<a/> level; we will get to this in the next section. But on a workbook level, you will be able to see all subscriptions that are active for a certain workbook.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Lineage</strong>: Lineage is another rather new feature<a/> on Tableau Server. It is only available through the Data Management add-on, at additional cost, and will show you the dependencies of a data source.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">For more information<a/> on lineage, please check <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/dm_lineage.htm" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/dm_lineage.htm</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Usage</strong>: The <strong class="keyWord">Usage</strong> tab gives you insights<a/> into how many people viewed your dashboard and how many other users added your dashboard as a favorite.</p>&#13;
    <div class="note">&#13;
      <p class="normal">The usage data can be accessed from the Tableau database too and hence can be used for further analytics.</p>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Lastly, please note the three dots on a workbook page, which contain more options as well as options we have seen before:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_28.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.28: Options</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Again, which ones you will be able to use depends on the permissions the Tableau Server admins gave you.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The available options look a little bit different when the selection is based on a published data source, like the<strong class="keyWord"> </strong><code class="inlineCode">My Superstore</code> data source<strong class="keyWord"> </strong>that we published to Tableau Server at the beginning of this chapter:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_29.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.29: Options II</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Most of the items are self-explanatory, but I want to point out <strong class="keyWord">Quality Warning</strong>, which is available at an<a/> additional cost within the Data Management add-on.<strong class="keyWord"> </strong>This feature will allow you to alert every user of the data or any workbook based on the data to be extra careful when using it.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Depending on the settings, Tableau Server will show warnings of various types, such as <strong class="keyWord">Deprecated</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Stale data</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Under maintenance</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">Sensitive data</strong>, which are selectable from a dropdown.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You can also decide whether you want to show the type on the data source only or also on the related workbooks. The following is an example of on the data source only:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_30.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.30: Data quality warning</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">And here is an example of how<a/> the warning looks on the workbook level:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_31.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.31: Data quality warning II</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">And even when opening the view:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_32.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.32: Data quality warning III</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This is a very powerful feature<a/> and shows how Tableau matures more and more with each release. Data quality is the focal point for many data strategies and the base of all analytics. Tableau Server is adapted to it and provides you with features that will grow along with your data strategy and quality measures.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Ask Data</strong>: The last item before we continue<a/> with the view level is<strong class="keyWord"> Ask Data</strong>,<strong class="keyWord"> </strong>which is only available for Tableau Server. To access <strong class="screenText">Ask Data</strong>, select a published data source and click on the first tab. Now the fun part starts, where Tableau<a/> Server will help you build visualizations based on <strong class="keyWord">Natural Language Processing</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">NLP</strong>):</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_33.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.33: Ask Data</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">On the left-hand side, you see all available fields, and in the middle, you can create a so-called <strong class="keyWord">lens</strong>. A lens can be user- or group-specific<a/> and serves the purpose of making it easier for users to ask the right questions and hence retrieve the right information using NLP on a data source. It is thus a more structured and governed approach of NLP. You will even see more<a/> tips popping up:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_34.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.34: Ask Data II</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">But back to creating a lens. First, select the fields you want to make available to your users:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_35.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.35: Select Fields</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Submit your setting and see how the <strong class="screenText">Data</strong> pane on the right has changed – it is much more limited now:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">And now, your users<a/> can start asking for information like:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">You can see that I typed <code class="inlineCode">profit each year</code> and Tableau<a/> proposed four different options to choose from. I select the third one and hit the arrow button. See what happens now:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">Tableau Server created<a/> a view. You can also add synonyms for each entry in your dataset and try out one of the many suggestions that Tableau has for you.</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">How cool is <strong class="keyWord">Ask Data</strong>? In my opinion, this feature<a/> is especially powerful because, even though Tableau is very intuitive, many people are not as data-savvy as you are. Providing a high-quality dataset and publishing it to Tableau Server will allow even more people to become data-driven and perform a quick analysis themselves. This will help<a/> you to focus on more complex dashboards, while ad hoc questions can be answered using this feature.</p>&#13;

    <h2 class="heading-2">Features on the view level</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We have covered<a/> all settings on the workbook level, so now we will take a closer look at a lower level, the view. The view looks something like this, and the settings in the red frame are of interest for this section:</p>&#13;

Your view may contain, for example, a specific filter selection, a different parameter selection than the default view, and maybe a set that is most important to you. Instead of having to change filters, parameters, and sets every time you open the view, you can use the <strong class="screenText">View</strong> tab:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Alerts</strong>: As of the time of writing, an alert can be set on a continuous numerical axis only. However, there are ideas being discussed on the Tableau forum that will increase the flexibility of setting alerts.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the Tableau Ideas<a/> forum, users can write down what ideas they have for future releases and the community can vote for them. Ideas with high votes are likely<a/> to be picked up soon. You can find the forum here: <a href="https://community.tableau.com/community/ideas" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://community.tableau.com/community/ideas</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Alerts</strong> button and text on the right side will show:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_47.png" alt=""/></figure><figure class="mediaobject">Figure 14.47: Alerts</figure><p class="normal">After selecting a numeric axis (like <strong class="keyWord">Sales</strong>), a new popup will appear in which a condition and a threshold can be entered. Also, the frequency of the threshold check can be specified:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">If an alert is set, all users and groups specified in that alert will receive an email once the threshold has been breached. The email<a/> will contain a static image and a link to the interactive version on Tableau Server.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Metrics</strong>: As mentioned before, this is a relatively<a/> new feature. In order to create a metric, select a mark in any view and click on the <strong class="screenText">Metrics</strong> tab. The following screen opens on the right side of the view:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_49.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.49: Metrics</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Metrics</strong> feature is very well integrated<a/> with Tableau Mobile and hence can be used to show key performance indicators to anyone, wherever they are. After clicking <strong class="screenText">Create</strong>, the metric view can be accessed from the project it has been saved to.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Subscribe</strong>: Subscriptions are meant to be used<a/> for frequent-email updates. They work in a similar way to alerts; people or groups can be subscribed and will receive an email with an overview of the relevant dashboard at a set time. The scheduling can be predefined by the administrator: for example, every morning at 7 AM.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Share</strong>: By clicking on <strong class="screenText">Share</strong>, a popup opens that allows<a/> you to share the URL to the view with anyone that is known to Tableau Server. That person will receive an email with the link. Make sure that that user has access to the project or else they will fail to open the view:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Download</strong>: Tableau Server also offers a download<a/> functionality. Depending on the configuration done by your admin, you can select between different formats for downloading purposes:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Comments</strong>: Last but not least, you can comment<a/> on views—original or edited, both are possible. To do so, click on the <strong class="keyWord">Comments</strong> button in the upper-right corner:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_14_52.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.52: Comments</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You can mention a colleague in the comment with <code class="inlineCode">@colleaguesname</code>, and they will receive an email with your comment in it. It is also possible to add screenshots to your comment.</p>&#13;

<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">We began this chapter by looking at Tableau Server settings, we learned that revision history features can provide a safety net against inadvertently overwriting files. We explored a section on the Tableau Server web authoring environment, which compared that environment with Tableau Desktop. This section’s main purpose was to establish a knowledge base for determining which personnel should have Tableau Desktop licenses and for whom the web authoring capabilities of Tableau Server should suffice.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Then we discussed user filters. User filters enable the Tableau author to ensure that users are only able to access data for which they have clearance. And finally, we looked at some handy features, such as alerts, subscriptions, commenting, and others.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will branch out from the Tableau world and will consider how to integrate it with R and Python. Knowledge of programming integration will help the Tableau author accomplish analytics tasks beyond Tableau’s capabilities, while still using Tableau to visualize the results.</p>&#13;
