- en: Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud are online solutions for sharing, distributing,
    and collaborating on content created in Tableau Desktop and/or Tableau Public.
    Its benefits include providing an environment where end users can securely view,
    explore, and refresh both real-time and scheduled data visualizations. The main
    difference between Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud is that Tableau Server needs
    to be maintained by you, while Tableau Cloud is fully hosted in the cloud by Tableau
    and backed up by Amazon Web Services infrastructure. For ease of reading, we will
    further refer to both as Tableau Server.

    with Tableau Server. Topics such as installation and upgrades, authentication
    and access, security configuration, and command-line utilities are not related
    to the Tableau Desktop author’s interaction with Tableau Server and are thus not
    included in this chapter. However, the help documentation is quite good. Also
    consider watching some videos from Tableau Software about Tableau Server (for
    example, [https://www.youtube.com/c/tableausoftware/search?query=Tableau%20Server](https://www.youtube.com/c/tableausoftware/search?query=Tableau%20Server)).

    you want to share your work with your colleagues. Do they all need a Tableau Desktop
    license and installation to see your visualizations? Luckily, the answer is: NO!
    The best way to share Tableau dashboards is on Tableau Server. This way, your
    colleagues only need a Tableau Server viewing license, which is much cheaper than
    the developer license, and they can fully interact with the dashboard you built
    and uploaded to Server. A detailed description of the different roles in Tableau
    Server license models can be found here: [https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/license_manage.htm](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/license_manage.htm).'

    or add a description, which comes in handy, especially if you have lots of different
    data sources and you want to allow your users to look for the one they need. By
    adding tags, you will add a metadata layer that will allow your Tableau Server
    users to search for a given data source based on tags. You can also change the
    permissions. Your setup might be that different users are in different groups,
    so here you can select which group is allowed which permissions. And lastly, you
    can immediately upload the workbook with the data source such that both are available
    on Tableau Server.

- en: After you have published a dashboard to Tableau Server, how do you go about
    editing it? Well, Tableau offers two options. In the first option, both you and
    everyone else who has access and the rights to download the dashboard can download
    it, edit it in Tableau Desktop, and overwrite the latest version on Tableau Server
    with a new upload. The other option is to edit the dashboard live on Server. This
    feature is called **web authoring**. Web authoring is a Tableau Server feature
    that provides an interface for authoring that is similar to Tableau Desktop. Originally,
    the web authoring interface was limited, but more features are introduced with
    each version. Thus, the capability gap between the Tableau Server web authoring
    environment and Tableau Desktop has shrunk. The web authoring environment provides
    robust capabilities for creating and applying table calculations and provides
    capabilities for creating dashboards.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One important thing to note is, as opposed to simply adding a dimension filter
    to the **Filters** shelf, you might want to consider adding the **Sales Region**
    to the **Data Source** filter. This is important because any user with web authoring
    permission can simply remove a filter from the **Filters** shelf. In the case
    of this exercise, the user would then be able to see metrics for every region.
    Data source filters, however, cannot be removed via the web authoring environment
    and are thus more secure. Furthermore, a data source filter is workbook-wide,
    which further secures the data. However, if you don’t have web authoring enabled,
    the **Filters** shelf serves its purpose.

- en: The **Metrics** feature is very well integrated with Tableau Mobile and hence
    can be used to show key performance indicators to anyone, wherever they are. After
    clicking **Create**, the metric view can be accessed from the project it has been
    saved to.

    They work in a similar way to alerts; people or groups can be subscribed and will
    receive an email with an overview of the relevant dashboard at a set time. The
    scheduling can be predefined by the administrator: for example, every morning
    at 7 AM.'

    the URL to the view with anyone that is known to Tableau Server. That person will
    receive an email with the link. Make sure that that user has access to the project
    or else they will fail to open the view:'

- en: We began this chapter by looking at Tableau Server settings, we learned that
    revision history features can provide a safety net against inadvertently overwriting
    files. We explored a section on the Tableau Server web authoring environment,
    which compared that environment with Tableau Desktop. This section’s main purpose
    was to establish a knowledge base for determining which personnel should have
    Tableau Desktop licenses and for whom the web authoring capabilities of Tableau
    Server should suffice.

- en: Then we discussed user filters. User filters enable the Tableau author to ensure
    that users are only able to access data for which they have clearance. And finally,
    we looked at some handy features, such as alerts, subscriptions, commenting, and
    others.

- en: In the next chapter, we will branch out from the Tableau world and will consider
    how to integrate it with R and Python. Knowledge of programming integration will
    help the Tableau author accomplish analytics tasks beyond Tableau’s capabilities,
    while still using Tableau to visualize the results.
