<h1 class="chapterTitle">Developing Data Governance Practices</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">This last chapter is slightly different from the others. We will not discuss a feature to be used in a Tableau dashboard or on Tableau Server but rather the data capabilities related to data governance in Tableau – who has access to which data, who viewed which dashboard how often, what the data components of a dashboard are, where the data came from, and more.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We will discuss the following topics:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">What is data governance?</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Data governance principles</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Data governance in Tableau</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Follow-along examples</li>&#13;
    </ul><p class="normal">In recent times, especially in the last 20 years, data governance has gained more importance, which shows the increasing maturity in this field. While in earlier days, data governance was a sole IT task and often limited to data cataloging, today’s data governance is a task shared by many. The more data companies store, the more analysts they hire, the more data is used, and the more rules and guidelines are needed. Nowadays, companies get fined for a lack of proper data governance, and massive data security breaches and data leaks make it to the headlines increasingly often. Therefore, many institutions, like the EU, have adopted data protection laws and regulations containing data governance as one of the main pillars. An example is the GDPR for the EU and the CCPA for California.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Even if you are mostly interested in building dashboards and sharing data insights, it is, and will continue to become, more of a joint effort throughout a firm to protect data. Understanding policies and regulations, knowing how to use data governance tools, and acting responsibly are necessary for you too. Therefore, I dedicate this last chapter to data governance and all the built-in functionality Tableau has to offer in this space. Let’s start!</p>&#13;

<h1 class="heading-1">What is data governance?</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">Data governance is all about the<a/> generation and implementation of data-related policies following regulations and industry standards. Its primary goal is to guarantee the usefulness, accessibility, and security of information. Enhanced data governance leads to improved data analytics, granting analysts peace of mind by ensuring that the data they rely on originates from reliable sources, has been verified, and has undergone rigorous data quality assessments, among other measures.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">On the <a href="http://www.tableau.com" target="_blank"><span class="url">www.tableau.com</span></a> website, you <a/>can find a whitepaper that introduces Tableau users to data management, including data governance: <a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/tableau-data-management" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/tableau-data-management</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">And if you would prefer a video, you will find a walk-through at the following link: <a href="https://www.tableau.com/products/data-management#content-446367" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://www.tableau.com/products/data-management#content-446367</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Both the whitepaper and the video talk about this setup:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_01.png" alt="A picture containing text, screenshot, diagram, plan&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.1: Tableau data management</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In general, data governance encompasses key aspects such as ensuring data quality, addressing data security<a/> and privacy concerns, establishing data policies and standards, assigning data stewards, complying with regulations, and documenting data assets.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">So why does data governance matter?</strong> Robust data governance leads to improved data quality, lower data management <a/>costs, and greater data access. It enhances trustworthiness in data compliance, thus resulting in better decision-making, improved operational efficiency, and reduced risks. Tableau can be a valuable tool for data visualization and analysis within the data governance framework while adhering to proven policies and guidelines.</p>&#13;

<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Data governance principles</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you are planning to work on <a/>data governance, you should know that data governance principles are typically the heart and soul of the entire endeavor. To illustrate this, let’s examine the seven principles outlined in the GDPR (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank"><span class="url">https://gdpr-info.eu/</span></a>) as an example and explore how Tableau can be employed to enforce them <a/>effectively:</p>&#13;
    <ul><li class="bulletList">Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Purpose limitation</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Data minimization</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Accuracy</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Storage limitations</li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Integrity and confidentiality </li>&#13;
      <li class="bulletList">Accountability</li>&#13;
    </ul><h2 class="heading-2">Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This mandates that <a/>personal information collected for providing goods or services must be obtained lawfully and fairly, with individuals informed about the<a/> purpose of its use. Furthermore, personal information<a/> can only be collected with the explicit consent of the individuals, and a record of this consent must be kept.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Purpose limitation</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Personal information should only be<a/> collected for a specific and legitimate purpose, and it should not be used for a different or incompatible purpose unless explicit consent is obtained.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Data minimization</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The processing of personal information<a/> should be restricted to what is necessary to fulfill the intended purpose.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Accuracy</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Personal information must be collected <a/>accurately and maintained with regular updates to mitigate risks to individuals, and any inaccurate information should be promptly corrected or erased.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Storage limitation</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Personal information should be retained only for the duration necessary to fulfill the processing purpose unless it is required <a/>for scientific, archival, or public interest purposes, in which case it may be stored for a longer period.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Integrity and confidentiality</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Integrity in the GDPR requires <a/>maintaining accurate and reliable personal data, while confidentiality mandates protecting personal data from unauthorized access and disclosure, ensuring privacy rights are upheld.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Accountability</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">For a successful data governance <a/>approach, accountability is crucial as it provides direction and effectiveness; establishing a data governance council comprising representatives from all departments, including senior executives, is essential to ensure cross-organization responsibility and the development and enforcement of data processes and policies. Let’s see how Tableau can help us stick to these principles in the next section.</p>&#13;

    <h2 class="heading-2">Version control</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau provides version control <a/>capabilities that enable organizations to track changes made to dashboards and data sources, promoting data governance by offering visibility into modifications and facilitating the audit trail process.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Version control makes it easier to adhere to the GDPR principle of <strong class="keyWord">lawfulness, fairness, and transparency</strong> because of its audit trail functionality.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Monitoring and auditing</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau’s monitoring and auditing<a/> features enable administrators to track user activities, access patterns, and data usage, aiding in identifying potential compliance issues and ensuring adherence to data governance policies.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Monitoring and auditing make it easier to adhere to the GDPR principle of <strong class="keyWord">lawfulness, fairness, and transparency</strong> because it helps us to comply with rules and regulations. </p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Collaboration and documentation</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Tableau supports collaboration <a/>and documentation by offering features like commenting, annotations, and document attachments, empowering users to document and discuss data assets, definitions, and governance-related information directly within the Tableau environment.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Collaboration and documentation make it easier to adhere to the GDPR principle of <strong class="keyWord">accountability</strong> because comments and annotations are visible and shared between users.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">While Tableau offers data<a/> governance capabilities, it is crucial for organizations to have a comprehensive data governance strategy and framework that extends beyond the Tableau platform. Tableau’s features can enhance, and align with, broader data governance initiatives, but they should be integrated into an overarching governance program to maximize effectiveness.</p>&#13;

<section id="ch16lvl1sec08">&#13;
<div class="epub-source">&#13;
<h1 class="heading-1">Follow-along examples</h1>&#13;
<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this last part of the chapter, you can try some of the data governance features yourself; feel free to follow along in your version of Tableau Server.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Certifying data sources</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Certifying a data source involves<a/> designating it as a trusted and reliable asset through a process that verifies its quality, accuracy, and compliance. This certification instills trust, ensures data quality, supports compliance, promotes consistency, strengthens data governance, enhances decision-making, facilitates data discovery, and is conducted by data governance teams or experts within an organization.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You can certify a data source in Tableau by following these steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Open Tableau Server.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Open a data source.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the three dots next to the data source name.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="screenText">Edit Certification…</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_02.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.2: Certification</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="5">You can now type a message visible to data source users holding the reason for the certification<a/> or similar. What you type depends on the policies agreed on in your firm. Click <strong class="screenText">Save</strong>.</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_03.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.3: Certification message</p>&#13;

    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_04.png" alt="A picture containing diagram&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.4: Certified</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Certified data sources <a/>help decision-making, enabling analysts and business users to have heightened confidence in the data they utilize, resulting in more precise insights, well-informed decisions, and enhanced business outcomes.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Data quality warnings</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Data quality warnings are notifications that highlight potential issues or anomalies in dataset quality, triggered by incomplete or missing data, inconsistencies, outliers, data integrity problems, validation <a/>failures, or outdated information. These warnings signal the need for further investigation and data cleansing to ensure correct analysis and decision-making, emphasizing the importance of addressing data quality issues for reliable insights.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You can set up a data quality warning by following these steps:</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="1">Open Tableau Server.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Open a data source.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="keyWord">the three dots next to</strong> the data source name.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="keyWord">Quality Warning</strong> and then choose between <strong class="keyWord">Quality Warning …</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">Extract Refresh Monitoring …</strong>.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numberedList">The <strong class="screenText">Data Quality Warning</strong> pop-up will look like this:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_05.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.5: Data Quality Warning</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="6">From here, select <a/>one out of five labels from the dropdown <strong class="screenText">Select label</strong>:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_06.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.6: Select label</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="7">The <strong class="screenText">Extract Refresh Monitoring</strong> pop-up will look <a/>very similar, without a dropdown though:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_07.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.7: Extract Refresh Monitoring</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="8">In both <a/>cases, a <strong class="keyWord">Warning</strong> indicator will appear on the data source overview page:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_08.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.8: Warning</p>&#13;
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li class="numberedList" value="9">If a schedule<a/> extraction fails, you can also check the <strong class="screenText">Schedules</strong> overview page:</li>&#13;
    </ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_09.png" alt="Table&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with low confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.9: Schedules</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Data quality warnings serve as indicators that data may require further investigation or cleaning before it can be used for analysis, reporting, or decision-making. They help find potential data issues that could affect the accuracy, reliability, and validity of analytical results. Addressing data quality warnings often involves data cleansing, error correction, and ensuring the data aligns with the required quality standards.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">It is important to note that data quality warnings should be acted upon, as they can affect the reliability <a/>and validity of insights derived from the data. Resolving data quality issues and keeping high-quality data is crucial to making informed decisions and drawing exact conclusions from data analysis.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Tableau Lineage</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Data lineage is important as it establishes trust in data, aids in data quality management and issue resolution, facilitates impact analysis, supports compliance with regulations, strengthens data <a/>governance and management practices, assists in troubleshooting and debugging, and enables successful data and system integration. Data lineage provides transparency, understanding, and control over data flows, contributing to improved data governance and decision-making processes.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To see the lineage, you can open any type of overview page, data sources, prep flows, sheets, workbooks, and others on Tableau Server and check the <strong class="screenText">Lineage</strong> tab:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_10.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, Word&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.10: Tableau lineage</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The right-hand panel <a/>provides you with all the details about the respective lineage. From here, you can click on any of the given components and will be redirected there.</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_11.png" alt="Text&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.11: Detailed lineage</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">From the table view, you <a/>can even check where a column is used; first, go to a table:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_12.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.12: Upstream tables</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Then, click on any of the columns. Observe how the right-hand panel shows that the column <strong class="screenText">City</strong> is used in the <strong class="screenText">Databases</strong> and the <strong class="screenText">Tables</strong> but not anywhere else:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_13.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.13: Column lineage</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Overall, data lineage provides transparency, understanding, and control over data flows. It supports data quality management, compliance efforts, and decision-making processes. By documenting<a/> the lineage of data, organizations can improve their data governance practices, enhance data trustworthiness, and mitigate risks associated with data management and analytics.</p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Data Details</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Data Details</strong> in Tableau help you and your <a/>users understand the data within a published dashboard. To access it, on any given dashboard, click on <strong class="screenText">Data Details</strong> in the top-left corner and observe the details popping up on the right:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_14.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Description automatically generated"/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.14: Tableau Data Details</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In a few seconds, <strong class="keyWord">Data Details</strong> allows <a/>you to see the views over time, the data sources, and the fields in use. </p>&#13;
    <h2 class="heading-2">Data Guide</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">A data guide, such as a data <a/>dictionary or data reference guide, is a documentation resource that provides detailed information about the structure, content, and meaning of data elements. It is important for data understanding, consistency, integration, quality assessment, governance, collaboration, training, and documentation. A data guide enhances data management practices, promotes data literacy, and supports effective data utilization within organizations.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">For the exploration of the data guide, please open a dashboard on Tableau Server and click on the <strong class="screenText">Data Guide</strong> button in the right section of the blue top bar:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_15.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.15: Data Guide</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">By selecting a mark in the<a/> view, the data guide automatically populates details about the data point and filters used, and also an explanation. You already know this feature from <strong class="keyWord">Explain Data</strong> in prior chapters of this book, but the data guide makes the explanation and exploration of marks easier than ever.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Here is one more example that clearly shows how Tableau bridges the gap between a single data point and the average of the full dataset:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_16.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.16: Explanations</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">By clicking on a single<a/> arrow, more information comes up:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_17.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.17: Text explanation</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">And you can even generate graphs that prove the point:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_18.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.18: Contributing dimensions</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The data guide also lets<a/> you add descriptions and resources for your users:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/B18435_16_19.png" alt=""/></figure><p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.19: Description</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">And this was the last example in the realm of data governance in Tableau. This is a huge topic and one that extends far beyond the remit of Tableau, so we have only just scratched the surface by looking into the GDPR – one of many data regulations – the data governance functionality in Tableau, and finally some real-life applications. This topic really deserves a book of its own, but I wanted to address it here in short to share the responsibility because even you, as a Tableau developer, have a responsibility and can make a difference in <a/>keeping our data safe. Hopefully, this last chapter has given you enough food for thought to start paying more attention to data governance while developing fabulous dashboards.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now that we’ve reached the end of the book, consider our journey, which started with loading data into Tableau, creating our first visualizations, and executing our first functions. We moved on by familiarizing ourselves with the level of detail and table calculations, learning about Tableau Prep Builder, Tableau Server, and general visualization best practices before our final round, in which we learned about advanced analytics and leveraging the power of Tableau programming tool integration.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This leaves me with just one question: what will your next Tableau project be? Feel free to share it on Tableau Public and don’t forget to add the tag <strong class="keyWord">#MasteringTableau</strong>. I want to congratulate you all for participating and engaging in this learning process! Whether you have more questions, remarks, or feedback, feel free to reach out to me or to the Tableau community. I wish you a<a/> lot of success with your personal Tableau career.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Happy Tableau’ing!</p>&#13;
