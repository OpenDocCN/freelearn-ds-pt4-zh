    a feature to be used in a Tableau dashboard or on Tableau Server but rather the
    data capabilities related to data governance in Tableau – who has access to which
    data, who viewed which dashboard how often, what the data components of a dashboard
    are, where the data came from, and more.

- en: In recent times, especially in the last 20 years, data governance has gained
    more importance, which shows the increasing maturity in this field. While in earlier
    days, data governance was a sole IT task and often limited to data cataloging,
    today’s data governance is a task shared by many. The more data companies store,
    the more analysts they hire, the more data is used, and the more rules and guidelines
    are needed. Nowadays, companies get fined for a lack of proper data governance,
    and massive data security breaches and data leaks make it to the headlines increasingly
    often. Therefore, many institutions, like the EU, have adopted data protection
    laws and regulations containing data governance as one of the main pillars. An
    example is the GDPR for the EU and the CCPA for California.

    it is, and will continue to become, more of a joint effort throughout a firm to
    protect data. Understanding policies and regulations, knowing how to use data
    governance tools, and acting responsibly are necessary for you too. Therefore,
    I dedicate this last chapter to data governance and all the built-in functionality
    Tableau has to offer in this space. Let’s start!

    policies following regulations and industry standards. Its primary goal is to
    guarantee the usefulness, accessibility, and security of information. Enhanced
    data governance leads to improved data analytics, granting analysts peace of mind
    by ensuring that the data they rely on originates from reliable sources, has been
    verified, and has undergone rigorous data quality assessments, among other measures.
