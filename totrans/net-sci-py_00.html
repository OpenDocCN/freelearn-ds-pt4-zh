			<p>Networks are everywhere and in everything. Once you learn to see them, you will find them everywhere. Natural data is not structured. It is unstructured. Language is one example of unstructured data, and networks are another example. We are, at all times, being influenced by the things that exist around us. I wrote this book in the hope of showing how language data can be transformed into networks that can be analyzed and then showing how the analysis itself can <span class="No-Break">be implemented.</span></p>
			<p>This book does not intend to teach every aspect of network science but to give enough of an introduction so that the tools and techniques may be used confidently to uncover a new branch <span class="No-Break">of insights.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>My intention for this book was for it to serve as a bridge between computer science and the social sciences. I want both sides to benefit, not just one. My hopes are that software engineers will learn useful tools and techniques from the social sciences, as I have, and also that those in the social sciences will be able to scale up their ideas and research using software engineering. Data scientists will also find this book useful for going deeper into <span class="No-Break">network analysis.</span></p>
			<p>However, this book will not just be useful to social scientists, software engineers, and data scientists. Influence happens all around us. Understanding how to measure influence or map the flow of ideas can be very useful in <span class="No-Break">many fields.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B17105_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Natural Language Processing</em>, introduces <strong class="bold">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLP</strong>) and how language and networks relate. We will discuss what NLP is, where it can be useful, and walk through several use cases. By the end of this chapter, the reader will have a basic understanding of NLP, what it is, what it looks like, and how to get started in using NLP to <span class="No-Break">investigate data.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Network Analysis</em>, introduces network analysis, which is useful for analyzing aspects of a network, such as its overall structure, key nodes, communities, and components. We will discuss different types of networks and different use cases, and we will walk through a simple workflow for collecting data for network research. This chapter gives a gentle introduction to understanding networks and how understanding networks may be useful in <span class="No-Break">solving problems.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor080"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Useful Python Libraries</em>, discusses the Python libraries used in this book, including where to go for installation instructions and more. This chapter also provides some starter code to start using libraries and to check that they are working. Libraries are grouped into categories so that they can be easily understood and compared. We will discuss Python libraries for data analysis and processing, data visualization, NLP, network analysis and visualization, and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>). This book does not depend on a graph database, reducing the overhead of learning network <span class="No-Break">analysis skills.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor158"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">NLP and Network Synergy</em>, discusses how to take text data and convert it into networks that can be analyzed. We will learn to load text data, extract entities (people, places, organizations, and more), and construct social networks using text alone. This allows us to create visual maps of how characters and people interact in a body of text, and these can serve as a way to interactively gain a richer contextual awareness of the content or entities <span class="No-Break">being studied.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will also discuss crawling, also known as web scraping. Learning how to collect data from the internet and use it in NLP and network analysis will supercharge an individual’s ability to learn about either or both. It also unlocks the ability to research things that interest you rather than using someone <span class="No-Break">else’s datasets.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we will convert the text into an actual network and visualize it. This is a very long chapter because it covers each of the steps involved in converting text <span class="No-Break">into networks.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor179"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Even Easier Scraping</em>, shows even easier methods for collecting text data from the internet. Certain Python libraries have been created for pulling text data from news sites, blog websites, and social media. This chapter will show you how to easily and quickly get clean text data for use in downstream processes. In this chapter, we will convert text into an actual network, and then we will visualize <span class="No-Break">the network.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor228"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Graph Construction and Cleaning</em>, dives into working with networks. The chapter starts by showing how to create a graph using an edge list and then describes important concepts such as nodes and edges. Over the course of the chapter, we will learn to add, edit, and remove nodes and edges from graphs, which is all a part of graph construction and cleaning. We will conclude the chapter with a simulation of a network attack, showing the catastrophically destructive effect that removing even a few key nodes can have on a network. This shows the importance that individual nodes have on an <span class="No-Break">entire network.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor261"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Whole Network Analysis</em>, is where we really get started with network analysis. For instance, we will look for answers on the size, complexity, and structure of the network. We will look for influential and important nodes and use connected components to identify structures that exist in the network. We will also briefly discuss community detection, which is covered in much greater depth in <a href="B17105_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor364"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor313"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Egocentric Network Analysis</em>, investigates the egocentric networks that exist in a network. This means that we will look closer at nodes of interest (ego nodes) and the nodes that surround them (alters). The goal is to understand the social fabric that exists around an ego node. This can also be useful for recognizing the communities that an individual <span class="No-Break">belongs to.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor364"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Community Detection</em>, discusses several approaches to identifying the communities that exist in a network. Several powerful algorithms for community detection will be shown and discussed. We will also discuss how connected components can be used to <span class="No-Break">identify communities.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor394"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Supervised Machine Learning on Network Data</em>, shows how we can use networks to create training data for ML classification tasks. In this chapter, we will create training data by hand, extracting useful features from a network. We will then combine those features into training data and build a model <span class="No-Break">for classification.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B17105_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor432"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Unsupervised Machine Learning on Network Data</em>, shows how unsupervised ML can be useful for creating node embeddings that can be used for classification. In the previous chapter, we created network features by hand. In this chapter, we will show how to create node embeddings using Karate Club and then use them for classification. We will also show how to use Karate Club’s GraphML models for <span class="No-Break">community detection.</span></p>
