- en: Networks are everywhere and in everything. Once you learn to see them, you will
    find them everywhere. Natural data is not structured. It is unstructured. Language
    is one example of unstructured data, and networks are another example. We are,
    at all times, being influenced by the things that exist around us. I wrote this
    book in the hope of showing how language data can be transformed into networks
    that can be analyzed and then showing how the analysis itself can be implemented.

    enough of an introduction so that the tools and techniques may be used confidently

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My intention for this book was for it to serve as a bridge between computer
    science and the social sciences. I want both sides to benefit, not just one. My
    hopes are that software engineers will learn useful tools and techniques from
    the social sciences, as I have, and also that those in the social sciences will
    be able to scale up their ideas and research using software engineering. Data
    scientists will also find this book useful for going deeper into network analysis.

    and data scientists. Influence happens all around us. Understanding how to measure
    influence or map the flow of ideas can be very useful in many fields.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17105_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Introducing Natural Language
    Processing*, introduces **natural language processing** (**NLP**) and how language
    and networks relate. We will discuss what NLP is, where it can be useful, and
    walk through several use cases. By the end of this chapter, the reader will have
    a basic understanding of NLP, what it is, what it looks like, and how to get started
    in using NLP to investigate data.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B17105_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048), *Network Analysis*, introduces
    network analysis, which is useful for analyzing aspects of a network, such as
    its overall structure, key nodes, communities, and components. We will discuss
    different types of networks and different use cases, and we will walk through
    a simple workflow for collecting data for network research. This chapter gives
    a gentle introduction to understanding networks and how understanding networks
    may be useful in solving problems.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17105_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor080), *Useful Python Libraries*,
    discusses the Python libraries used in this book, including where to go for installation
    instructions and more. This chapter also provides some starter code to start using
    libraries and to check that they are working. Libraries are grouped into categories
    so that they can be easily understood and compared. We will discuss Python libraries
    for data analysis and processing, data visualization, NLP, network analysis and
    visualization, and **machine learning** (**ML**). This book does not depend on
    a graph database, reducing the overhead of learning network analysis skills.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B17105_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor158), *NLP and Network Synergy*,
    discusses how to take text data and convert it into networks that can be analyzed.
    We will learn to load text data, extract entities (people, places, organizations,
    and more), and construct social networks using text alone. This allows us to create
    visual maps of how characters and people interact in a body of text, and these
    can serve as a way to interactively gain a richer contextual awareness of the
    content or entities being studied.'

- en: In this chapter, we will also discuss crawling, also known as web scraping.
    Learning how to collect data from the internet and use it in NLP and network analysis
    will supercharge an individual’s ability to learn about either or both. It also
    unlocks the ability to research things that interest you rather than using someone
    else’s datasets.

    is a very long chapter because it covers each of the steps involved in converting
    text into networks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B17105_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor179), *Even Easier Scraping*, shows
    even easier methods for collecting text data from the internet. Certain Python
    libraries have been created for pulling text data from news sites, blog websites,
    and social media. This chapter will show you how to easily and quickly get clean
    text data for use in downstream processes. In this chapter, we will convert text
    into an actual network, and then we will visualize the network.'

- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B17105_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor228), *Graph Construction and Cleaning*,
    dives into working with networks. The chapter starts by showing how to create
    a graph using an edge list and then describes important concepts such as nodes
    and edges. Over the course of the chapter, we will learn to add, edit, and remove
    nodes and edges from graphs, which is all a part of graph construction and cleaning.
    We will conclude the chapter with a simulation of a network attack, showing the
    catastrophically destructive effect that removing even a few key nodes can have
    on a network. This shows the importance that individual nodes have on an entire
    network.'

    is where we really get started with network analysis. For instance, we will look
    for answers on the size, complexity, and structure of the network. We will look
    for influential and important nodes and use connected components to identify structures
    that exist in the network. We will also briefly discuss community detection, which
    is covered in much greater depth in [*Chapter 9*](B17105_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor364).'

- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B17105_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor313), *Egocentric Network Analysis*,
    investigates the egocentric networks that exist in a network. This means that
    we will look closer at nodes of interest (ego nodes) and the nodes that surround
    them (alters). The goal is to understand the social fabric that exists around
    an ego node. This can also be useful for recognizing the communities that an individual
    belongs to.'

    several approaches to identifying the communities that exist in a network. Several
    powerful algorithms for community detection will be shown and discussed. We will
    also discuss how connected components can be used to identify communities.'

    on Network Data*, shows how we can use networks to create training data for ML
    classification tasks. In this chapter, we will create training data by hand, extracting
    useful features from a network. We will then combine those features into training
    data and build a model for classification.'

    on Network Data*, shows how unsupervised ML can be useful for creating node embeddings
    that can be used for classification. In the previous chapter, we created network
    features by hand. In this chapter, we will show how to create node embeddings
    using Karate Club and then use them for classification. We will also show how
    to use Karate Club’s GraphML models for community detection.'
