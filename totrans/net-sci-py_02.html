			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Network Analysis</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, I am going to describe three different topics, but at a very high level: <em class="italic">graph theory</em>, <em class="italic">social network analysis</em>, and <em class="italic">network science</em>. We will begin by discussing some of the confusion around the word <em class="italic">network</em> and why that will probably remain confusing. Then, we will go over a tiny bit of the past and present of all three. Finally, we will dive into how network analysis has helped me and hopefully how it can help you. This isn’t a code-heavy chapter. This is a <span class="No-Break">high-level introduction.</span></p>
			<p>The following topics will be discussed in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The confusion <span class="No-Break">behind networks</span></li>
				<li>What is this <span class="No-Break">network stuff?</span></li>
				<li>Resources for learning <span class="No-Break">network analysis</span></li>
				<li>Common network <span class="No-Break">use cases</span></li>
				<li>Advanced network <span class="No-Break">use cases</span></li>
				<li>Getting started <span class="No-Break">with networks</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>The confusion behind networks</h1>
			<p>First, to reduce confusion, if you see me mention <em class="italic">NetworkX</em>, that <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>is not a typo. That is a Python library we will be making heavy use of in this book. Python is a very popular <span class="No-Break">programming language.</span></p>
			<p>I have<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> worked in <strong class="bold">information technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>) my entire career, and have even gone farther than that. During some points of my career, I pursued security certifications such as Security+ and CISSP for job requirements, and I have constantly worked with other IT professionals, such as network engineers. So, believe me when I tell you that I understand the awkwardness that is involved in discussing network science with people who view networks as primarily based on TCP/IP <span class="No-Break">and subnets.</span></p>
			<p>Networks are all around us and even inside of us. In fact, our brain is the most complex thing we have found in the universe, as discussed in the book <em class="italic">How to Create a Mind </em>(Kurzweil, 2012). Our brain comprises of hundreds of billions of cells interlinked through trillions of connections. What a <span class="No-Break">complex network!</span></p>
			<p>When I think of all that we have achieved with artificial neural networks and how well they do for translation, computer vision, and generation, I think they are impressive, but I am much more impressed with how these ultra-complex minds of ours naturally evolved, and how foolish we sometimes are even with all of <span class="No-Break">that complexity.</span></p>
			<p>Back to my point, <em class="italic">networks</em> are <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>not just computer networks. Networks are comprised of relationships and information exchanges <span class="No-Break">between things.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, when I talk about networks, I am talking <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>about <em class="italic">graphs</em>. I am talking about the complex relationships between things. One of my favorite books on this subject, titled <em class="italic">Networks</em> (Newman, 2018), describes a few different kinds of networks, such as<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Technological networks</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break">Internet</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Power grid</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Telephone networks</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Transportation networks</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break">Airline routes</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Roads</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Rail networks</span></li></ul></li><li>Delivery and <span class="No-Break">distribution networks</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Information</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker096"/></span><span class="No-Break"> networks</span><ul><li>World <span class="No-Break">wide web</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Citation networks</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Peer-to-peer networks</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Recommender networks</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Keyword indexes</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Dataflow networks</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Social</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker097"/></span><span class="No-Break"> networks</span><ul><li>Social <span class="No-Break">interaction networks</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Ego-centric networks</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Affiliation/collaboration networks</span></li></ul></li>

			</ul>
			<p>Personally, my favorite networks are social networks (not social media companies), as they allow us to map out and understand a bit about the relationships between people, even on a massive scale. My <em class="italic">least</em> favorite networks <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>are computer networks, as I am just not interested in subnet masking or different computer <span class="No-Break">network architectures.</span></p>
			<p>In this beautiful universe, graph theory, social network analysis, and network science give you the ability to investigate and interrogate relationships that many people don’t even notice <span class="No-Break">or recognize.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, you will see the words graphs and networks used interchangeably. They are essentially the same structures<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> but often for different purposes. We use graphs in <em class="italic">NetworkX</em> for network analysis. Those graphs are also called <strong class="bold">sociograms</strong> when they are visualized for social network analysis. Yes, that is confusing. You will get through this confusion, I promise. To make my life easier, I tell myself that they are the same things with different names, sometimes used for <span class="No-Break">different purposes.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>What is this network stuff?</h1>
			<p>Let’s break things down a little further. I want to discuss the differences between graph theory, social network analysis, and network science separately. I am going to keep this very high level so that we can get to building as soon as possible. There are probably dozens of books available on Amazon if you want to dive deeper into any of these, and I personally probably have 10 or so books and will buy more as soon as I notice a new one <span class="No-Break">is out.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Graph theory</h2>
			<p>There has<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> been a lot of excitement about <strong class="bold">graph theory</strong> lately. I have noticed it the most in data science communities, but I have even seen database administrators and security professionals take an interest. Judging by the hype, one could assume that graph theory is something brand new, but it is actually <em class="italic">hundreds</em> of <span class="No-Break">years old.</span></p>
			<h3>History and origins of graph theory</h3>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> history and origins of graph theory began in 1735, 286 years ago. Back then, there was a puzzle called <em class="italic">The Seven Bridges of Königsberg</em>, where the goal was to find a way to cross every one of the seven bridges without crossing any bridge twice. In 1735, Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler proved that the puzzle was unsolvable. There was simply no way to cross each of the bridges without traversing a bridge twice. In 1736, Euler wrote a paper on this proof, which became the first-ever paper in the history of <span class="No-Break">graph theory.</span></p>
			<p>In 1857, an Irish mathematician, William Rowan Hamilton, invented a puzzle called the Icosian game that involved finding a special type of path, later known as a <span class="No-Break">Hamiltonian circuit.</span></p>
			<p>Almost 150 years after Euler’s paper, in 1878, the term <em class="italic">graph</em> was introduced by James Joseph Sylvester in a paper published <span class="No-Break">in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Nature</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, in 1936, the<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> very first textbook on graph theory, <em class="italic">Theory of Finite and Infinite Graphs</em>, was written by Hungarian mathematician Dénes Kőnig, 201 years after Euler solved the seven bridges puzzle. In 1969, the definitive textbook on graph theory was written by American mathematician <span class="No-Break">Frank Harary.</span></p>
			<p>So, in other words, graph theory is <span class="No-Break">not new.</span></p>
			<h3>Practical application of graph theory</h3>
			<p>Currently, there <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>is much interest in graph theory as it relates to finding optimal paths. This is valuable knowledge due to its application in routing data, products, and people from point A to point B. We can see this in action when mapping software finds the shortest path between a source and a destination location. I also use paths in troubleshooting production database and software problems, so there are more applications <span class="No-Break">than transportation.</span></p>
			<p>We will work with the shortest paths throughout this book. <span class="No-Break">Keep reading!</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Social network analysis</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Social network analysis</strong> has <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>not received anywhere near the amount of hype that graph theory has, and I think that is a shame. Social network analysis is the analysis of social networks – the social fabric – that we are all a part of. If you study social networks, you learn to understand people’s behaviors better. You can investigate who people interact with, who they hate, who they love, how drug addiction spreads, how white supremacists organize, how terrorists operate, how fraud is carried out, how malware spreads, how pandemics can be stopped, and on and on and on. There is math involved, but in my own research, I am most interested in uncovering social interaction. You can do social network analysis without writing out a single equation, so long as you understand what the techniques do, what assumptions they make, and how to tell whether they are working or not. Mathematically, I would say this is a friendly field, even if you are not mathematically inclined. However, mathematical prowess can be a superpower here, as it will allow you to dream up your own techniques that can be used to dissect networks and <span class="No-Break">find insights.</span></p>
			<h3>History and origins of social network analysis</h3>
			<p>There is significant overlap between graph theory and social network analysis, as ideas such as the<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> shortest path can be useful in a social network context for determining the number of handshakes it would take to get from where you are currently sitting to meeting the president, for instance. Or who would you have to meet in order to have a chance to meet your <span class="No-Break">favorite celebrity?</span></p>
			<p>However, in the 1890s, French sociologist David Émile Durkheim and German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research on social groups. Tönnies argued that social groups exist as ties that link individuals who share values and beliefs (community) or impersonal and instrumental social links (society). On the other hand, Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals are part of a reality that is bigger than the properties of individual actors alone. I personally am intrigued by this idea, and I get a sense of this when I investigate where people are placed on a sociogram. Did the people create their position in a social network, or was some of it by chance, based on who they know and where their connections were already situated? For instance, if you are raised in certain parts of any country, you will likely inherit many of the sentiments shared by members of the community, but those sentiments may be much older than the living members of <span class="No-Break">the community.</span></p>
			<p>In the 1930s, major developments in social network analysis took place by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently. Even 90 years ago, social network analysis was already a multi-disciplinary topic. In the 1930s, Jacob Moreno was credited with creating the first sociograms to study interpersonal relationships, and people were so intrigued by these that one was printed in the New York Times in 1933. He stated that “<em class="italic">Before the advent of sociometry, no one knew what the interpersonal structure of a group ‘precisely’ looked like.</em>” Personally, whenever I visualize any social network that I have constructed for the first time, I feel that same intrigue. The network structure is a mystery until you first see it visualized, and it is always exciting to see it rendered for the <span class="No-Break">first time.</span></p>
			<p>In the 1970s, scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions of independent network research. Almost 50 years ago, people realized that independent research was going off in multiple directions, and there was an effort to bring it <span class="No-Break">all together.</span></p>
			<p>In the 1980s, theories and methods of social network analysis became pervasive among the social and <span class="No-Break">behavioral sciences.</span></p>
			<h3>Practical application of social network analysis</h3>
			<p>Social network analysis<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> can be used to study the relationship between any social entities. The goal of social network analysis is to understand how social entities and communities interact. This can be at the individual level or even at the <span class="No-Break">international level.</span></p>
			<p>This can even be used against literature. For instance, here is a social network I constructed from the book <em class="italic">Alice’s Adventures </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">in Wonderland</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_02_001.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Social network of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland" width="1601" height="1044"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Social network of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</p>
			<p>Here is a social network I constructed from the book <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Animal Farm</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_02_002.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Social network of Animal Farm" width="1540" height="1045"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Social network of Animal Farm</p>
			<p>These are<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> the original sociograms from when I first created them, so they could use a bit of work, and we’ll work on cleaning them up a bit and analyzing them as part of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>I adore social network analysis more than graph theory or network science. I want to understand people. I want to stop bad people and make the world safer. I want to stop malware and make the internet safer. This powers everything for me, and so I spend a lot of my free time researching and doing social network analysis. This is <span class="No-Break">my focus.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Network science</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Network science</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>another fascination of mine. Network science is about understanding how networks form and the implications of how <span class="No-Break">they form.</span></p>
			<h3>History and origins of network science</h3>
			<p>Like <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>social network analysis, there is an overlap between the origins of graph theory and network science. To me, network science seems more about unifying various network disciplines and bringing everything under one roof, as data science is an attempt to unify various data disciplines. In fact, lately, I see network science emerging in use among data scientists, so I predict that, eventually, network science will be considered a subfield of <span class="No-Break">data science.</span></p>
			<p>In books I have read on network science, the same story of Euler's Seven Bridges is given as the origin of network science, which shows that graph theory is the origin of network science. However, there were a few key efforts in the 1990s that focused on mathematically describing different <span class="No-Break">network topologies.</span></p>
			<p>Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz described the “small-world” network, where most nodes are not neighbors of each other but can reach each other in very few hops. Albert-László Barabási and Reka Albert discovered that small-world networks are not the norm in the real world and developed the scale-free network, where networks consist of a few hub nodes with many edges and many nodes with a few edges. This network topology would grow to maintain a constant ratio between the number of connections and all <span class="No-Break">other nodes.</span></p>
			<h3>Practical application of network science</h3>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>practical application of network science is also the practical application of graph theory and social network analysis. I feel that graph theory and social network analysis are part of network science, even if techniques are specialized for each subject. I personally do not differentiate, and I don’t think much about graph theory. I use techniques of graph theory and social network analysis when I do network science. When I do this via code, much of the mathematics of graph theory has been abstracted away, but I still very commonly use things such as shortest paths <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>and centralities, the former from graph theory and the latter from social <span class="No-Break">network analysis.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Resources for learning about network analysis</h1>
			<p>So, what is <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>needed to begin a journey into network thinking? I’ll give a few suggestions just to help you get started, but be aware that by the time this book has been published, some of this might already be a bit outdated and new technologies and techniques may have emerged. This is not a complete list. It is the bare minimum. The first thing that you need is a curious mind. If you are willing to investigate the hidden networks that make up our existence, then you already have the first prerequisite. Still, let me give you some <span class="No-Break">more suggestions.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Notebook interfaces</h2>
			<p>I do all <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>of my network analysis in Jupyter Notebooks. You can download and install Jupyter via Anaconda <span class="No-Break">at: </span><a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>If you don’t want to install Jupyter, you can also use Google Colab without any installation. You can find and immediately start using Google Colab <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://research.google.com/colaboratory"><span class="No-Break">https://research.google.com/colaboratory</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Rather than a<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> typical <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) used for software development, a notebook interface allows you to write code in “cells” and then run them sequentially or re-run them. This is useful for research, as you can quickly experiment with data, doing exploratory data analysis and visualization in real time in your web browser. Here is what that <span class="No-Break">looks like:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
df = pd.read_csv(data)
df['book'] = df['book'].str.lower()
df['entities'] = create_entity_list(df)
df.head()</pre>
			<p>The Bible is contained in the data file, so this will load the data and output a preview of the first five verses of <span class="No-Break">the Bible.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_02_003.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – pandas DataFrame of the Bible" width="1215" height="342"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – pandas DataFrame of the Bible</p>
			<p>Now, let’s see in which verses <strong class="source-inline">Eve</strong> is mentioned <span class="No-Break">in </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">genesis</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
entity_lookup('Eve', book='genesis')</pre>
			<p>This will display<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> a preview of the two verses in which <strong class="source-inline">Eve</strong> <span class="No-Break">was mentioned:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_02_004.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Eve mentions in Genesis" width="1132" height="164"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – Eve mentions in Genesis</p>
			<p>Let’s see how many times <strong class="source-inline">Eve</strong> is mentioned by name in the <span class="No-Break">entire Bible:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
entity_lookup('Eve')</pre>
			<p>Again, this will display a preview <span class="No-Break">of verses:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_02_005.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Eve mentions in the entire Bible" width="1212" height="275"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.5 – Eve mentions in the entire Bible</p>
			<p>I have<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> loaded the Bible dataset that I created and done a bit of wrangling and enrichment, and then I have created two additional cells that look for <strong class="source-inline">Eve</strong> in the book of Genesis and then in the entire Bible. If you look closely, you can see that I accidentally set <strong class="source-inline">df</strong> as a global variable, which is not good. I should fix that code. Oh well, next time. <span class="No-Break">It works.</span></p>
			<p>A notebook allows you to experiment with data and get really creative. There are pros and cons to notebooks, one of which I <span class="No-Break">previously mentioned.</span></p>
			<p>The pros are that you can very quickly and easily experiment on datasets, building out your code for loading, preprocessing, enrichment, and <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>even <strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) model development. You can do a LOT with a notebook, very quickly. It is my favorite tool for initial exploration <span class="No-Break">and development.</span></p>
			<p>The cons are that notebook code has a deserved reputation for being quick and dirty code, not something that really belongs in production. Another problem is that notebooks can get disorganized, with notebooks on our laptops and Jupyter servers (SageMaker, Kubeflow, and so on), so things can quickly get out of hand <span class="No-Break">and confusing.</span></p>
			<p>I recommend using them to explore data and get innovative, but once you have something that works well, take that code into an IDE and build it out properly. My preferred IDE is currently Visual Studio Code but use whatever you are comfortable with. IDEs will be defined in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<p>You can download<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> Visual Studio Code <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"><span class="No-Break">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>IDEs</h2>
			<p>An IDE is a <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>piece of software that is used for writing code. Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, PyCharm, IntelliJ, and many more. There are many different languages, and they often support multiple programming languages. Try a few and use whatever is most comfortable. If it slows you down too much for too long, it’s not the right one. However, there is typically a bit of a learning curve with any modern IDE, so be patient with yourself and with the software. If you want to learn more about available IDEs, just google <strong class="source-inline">popular IDEs</strong>. When getting started, I recommend setting some time aside to really learn how to use your chosen IDE. Watch videos and read the documentation. I typically do this every few years, but absolutely at <span class="No-Break">the beginning.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Network datasets</h2>
			<p>You can’t do<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> network analysis without data. You either need to create data, or you need to go find some. Creating network datasets can be easier, simpler, and less manual than creating other types of datasets (for instance, ML training data), and it can be a good way to build domain knowledge quickly. Our own interests and curiosities can be more enjoyable to investigate than using someone else’s dataset. But so that you know, there are network datasets out there that you can start with while you get comfortable with the network <span class="No-Break">analysis toolset:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer030" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6 – Google search: network science datasets</p>
			<p>All of<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> them look a bit neglected and basic, other than the top link. They appear not to have been updated in <span class="No-Break">several years.</span></p>
			<p>Searching for social network analysis datasets gives slightly more interesting-looking datasets, which makes sense, as social network analysis is older than network science. However, the top link is the same. If you want some pre-made data, take a look at the Stanford website as well <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">data.world</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – Google search: social network analysis datasets</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Kaggle datasets</h2>
			<p>Kaggle is<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> another decent place to look for data for just about anything. Kaggle is occasionally given unfair treatment by some people, who snub their noses at those who use Kaggle datasets because the data isn’t dirty like in the real world, but there is little difference between Kaggle data and the preceding datasets. They have all been scrubbed clean and are ready for you to practice with ML or network analysis tools. There are so many interesting datasets and problems to solve on Kaggle, and it is a great place to learn and build confidence. Use what <span class="No-Break">helps you.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>NetworkX and scikit-network graph generators</h2>
			<p>In this book, I will <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>explain how to use the Python libraries <em class="italic">NetworkX</em> and <em class="italic">scikit-network</em>. I use NetworkX for graph construction <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>and scikit-network for visualization. I do that because scikit-network has no real network analysis capabilities, but it renders network visualizations in <strong class="bold">Scalable Vector Graphics</strong> (<strong class="bold">SVG</strong>), which are much faster and bettee-looking than NetworkX visualizations. Both of these libraries also contain generators for several good practice networks. If you use them, you won’t get familiar with how to create a network from scratch, but it’s an OK place to start if you just want to experiment with a <span class="No-Break">pre-built network:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">NetworkX: </span><a href="https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generators.html"><span class="No-Break">https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generators.html</span></a></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">scikit-network: </span><a href="https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/data/toy_graphs.html"><span class="No-Break">https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/data/toy_graphs.html</span></a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>My recommendation is that you should just ignore the scikit-network loaders and get familiar with creating networks using NetworkX. It is just far superior, in my opinion. At this time, scikit-network is in no way a replacement for NetworkX, except <span class="No-Break">for visualization.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Creating your own datasets</h2>
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> book, I am going to show you how you can create your own datasets. Personally, I feel that this is the best approach, and this is what I do practically every time. Usually, I get an idea, write it on my whiteboard or in a notebook, figure out how to get the data, and then get to work. This typically takes a few days, and I’ll usually use an approach <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Come up with <span class="No-Break">an idea.</span></li>
				<li>Run to a whiteboard or notebook and write <span class="No-Break">it down.</span></li>
				<li>Go sit outside with a notebook and daydream about how I can get <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></li>
				<li>Set up some <span class="No-Break">web scrapers.</span></li>
				<li>Download the data after a day or two <span class="No-Break">of scraping.</span></li>
				<li>Extract entities from sentences and build an edge <span class="No-Break">list dataframe.</span></li>
				<li>Construct <span class="No-Break">the network.</span></li>
				<li>Dive into <span class="No-Break">network analysis.</span></li>
				<li>Visualize the things that <span class="No-Break">seem interesting.</span></li>
				<li>Play with ego graphs to look into ego networks for <span class="No-Break">additional perspective.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> definitely a process, and it seems like a lot of steps, but over time, it all blends together. You have an idea, get data, do preprocessing, and then analyze and use the data. In a way, that isn’t very different from other data <span class="No-Break">science workflows.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, I will explain how to take raw data and convert it into <span class="No-Break">network data.</span></p>
			<p>There are lots of options for where you can get network data. None of them are wrong. Some of them just skip steps and make things easier so that you can practice with tools and techniques. That is perfectly fine. However, you should aim to become self-sufficient and comfortable working with dirty data. Data is really never clean, even if someone seems to have done a lot of cleanup activity. There’s usually more to do, even in my own datasets from my own GitHub. Text is messy. You will need to get comfortable playing in the dirt. For me, that is my favorite part—taking gnarly text data and converting it into a beautiful and useful network. I <span class="No-Break">love it.</span></p>
			<p>So, get familiar with everything we’ve talked about and go explore. Maybe even consider making the first network data repository that somehow succeeds in bringing everything together if you are feeling <span class="No-Break">really ambitious.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>NetworkX and articles</h2>
			<p>Another thing I <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>have found useful for learning about network science is the article links that are posted directly on the NetworkX documentation website. When they describe their functions, they typically provide a link to an article about the technique that was used to build the function. Here is <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_02_008.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – NetworkX documentation: k_core algorithm" width="1418" height="1019"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8 – NetworkX documentation: k_core algorithm</p>
			<p>If you go to <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>the NetworkX page for <strong class="source-inline">k_core</strong>, you can see clear documentation about the function, parameters, what it returns, and some notes. This isn’t even the best part. The best part is buried a little deeper. Scroll down, and you will often see something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer033" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_02_009.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – NetworkX documentation: k-core article reference" width="1352" height="423"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9 – NetworkX documentation: k-core article reference</p>
			<p>Nice! There is an <span class="No-Break">arXiv link!</span></p>
			<p>It is so useful to<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> be able to read about the research that led to <strong class="source-inline">k_core</strong>. It is also somewhat of a relief, to me personally, to find out that so much stuff is actually quite old, for instance, what I mentioned<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> in terms of <strong class="bold">Natural Language Processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLP</strong>) history. We often hear that it is impossible to keep up with data science because things move so fast. That is only true if you are distracted by every shiny new thing. Focus on what you are trying to do, research ways to do what you want to do, and then build it. You shouldn’t only use newer techniques. New does not always, or even usually, <span class="No-Break">mean better.</span></p>
			<p>In the case of k_core, I was looking for a way to quickly throw away all nodes with one edge. In my first networks, I would write way too many lines of code to do that, trip over a list comprehension, or just write some nasty code that worked. However, I could have just done <strong class="source-inline">nx.k_core(G, 2)</strong>. That’s it. <span class="No-Break">Problem solved.</span></p>
			<p>So, read the documentation. Look for academic journal links if you want to learn more, and then build and build and build until you understand <span class="No-Break">the technique.</span></p>
			<p>You will find the same kinds of links for centralities or other topics on NetworkX. Just go explore. It’s good reading and <span class="No-Break">inspiring stuff.</span></p>
			<p>Very nice! This sets us up to learn more about the origins and use of centralities in <span class="No-Break">network analysis.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Common network use cases</h1>
			<p>As I did in <a href="B17105_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Natural Language Processing</em>, I will now also explain some of my own <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>favorite use cases for working with network data. I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter that there are many different kinds of networks, but I personally prefer working with social networks and what I call <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">dataflow networks</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Here are some of the uses I have for working with <span class="No-Break">network data:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mapping <span class="No-Break">production dataflows</span></li>
				<li>Mapping <span class="No-Break">community interactions</span></li>
				<li>Mapping literary <span class="No-Break">social networks</span></li>
				<li>Mapping historical <span class="No-Break">social networks</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Mapping language</span></li>
				<li>Mapping <span class="No-Break">dark networks</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I will start with dataflow networks, as that was the first use case I realized for network data and something that revolutionized how <span class="No-Break">I work.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Mapping production dataflow</h2>
			<p>As mentioned, this<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> was the first idea that I had for my own use of network data. I have worked in software for over 20 years, and I have spent a significant amount of time “dissecting” production code. This isn’t for fun. This has serious use. In the past, I had been asked to “uplift” old production systems, which means taking an old production system, figuring out everything that runs on it (code, databases, and file reads/writes), and migrating everything over to a new server so that the old server could be retired. We call this the <em class="italic">de-risking</em> of production systems. In the end, this results in a lightning-fast new production system because this is usually old code placed on very <span class="No-Break">new infrastructure.</span></p>
			<p>In my old way, I would take an inventory of production systems by starting with <strong class="source-inline">cron</strong>, the orchestration of how things run on a server. Starting at <strong class="source-inline">cron</strong> allows you to get to the root of a process and see what scripts call additional scripts. Often, if you map this out, you’ll end up with something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">cron:</span><ul><li><strong class="source-inline">script_a.php &gt; </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_a.log</strong></span></li><li><strong class="source-inline">script_b.php &gt; </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_b.log</strong></span></li><li><strong class="source-inline">script_c.php &gt; </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_c.log</strong></span></li><li><strong class="source-inline">script_c.php </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">uses script_d.php</strong></span></li><li><strong class="source-inline">script_c.php </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">uses script_e.php</strong></span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>And on, and on, and on. That’s not what <strong class="source-inline">cron</strong> actually looks like, but that shows the direction <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>of script calls and data writes. So, in the previous example, the code does <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">script_a.php</strong> writes to the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_a.log</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> logfile</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">script_b.php</strong> writes to the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_b.log</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> logfile</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">script_c.php</strong> writes to the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_c.log</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> logfile</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">script_c.php</strong> launches another <span class="No-Break">script, </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_d.php</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">script_c.php</strong> launches another <span class="No-Break">script, </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_e.php</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I used to do this by hand, and it was very tedious and exact work, as it can be catastrophic if you miss anything because it won’t be migrated or tested on the new server, and that is a painful thing to discover on migration day. On a server with a couple of hundred scripts, it would take a few weeks to even build a script map, and a full map of the entire input and output of the entire server would take much longer than that. From the preceding example, a script map would look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">cron:</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_a.php</strong></span></li><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_b.php</strong></span></li><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_c.php</strong></span><ul><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_d.php</strong></span></li><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">script_e.php</strong></span></li></ul></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In a production environment, this can go very deep and be very nested. In 2017, I found another way to do this, using networks, and the script map would build itself using the nodes and edges constructed in the graph. This could be an exceptionally long discussion that I could write an entire book on – and I have thought about doing just that – but to<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> save time, the new method takes roughly 10% of the amount of time as the old way and catches everything, as long as I am thorough in my source code analysis. I also do not have to maintain a mental image of what is going on in the server, as I have a graph visualization that I can visually inspect and a network that I can interrogate. Working 10 times faster, I can uplift many more servers in the same amount of time it used to take me to do a single one. I can also use this to quickly troubleshoot production problems once the network is built. Problems that used to take days to troubleshoot, now I can often do <span class="No-Break">in minutes.</span></p>
			<p>Another nice side effect is that if you want to re-engineer software and you use this approach, you can understand the inputs and outputs of everything on a server, and you can use that to find inefficiencies and come up with ideas on how to better build the software on a new platform. I have also done this, replacing SQL Server databases with Spark dataflows, and <span class="No-Break">very successfully.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Mapping community interactions</h2>
			<p>These <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>days, I no longer uplift production systems and have moved on to more exciting work, so everything else I am going to describe comes from my own independent research, not from things I do at work. For my own research, I do a lot of social media scraping and analysis, as it gives me a way to understand the world around me. One thing I like to understand is how people in certain groups interact with each other and with others outside of <span class="No-Break">their group.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, I scrape dozens of data science-related Twitter accounts so that I can keep an eye on the latest occurrences in the data science and scientific communities. After initially scraping a few accounts, I extract user mentions and map all the interactions between them. This helps me find additional users that are worth scraping and add them to my scrapers, and then I repeat extracting user mentions and map all the interactions between them as well. I do this over and over and over, constantly building out social networks for anything I am interested in—data science, natural science, art, photography, and even K-pop. I find analyzing communities intriguing, and it’s one of my favorite things to do. This is one topic I will spend a great deal of time covering in this book because I have seen how useful this can be to research, and I have even used the results of this scraping to build highly customized ML training data so that I can automatically find even more of what I want! The results are a beautiful combination of NLP, social network analysis, <span class="No-Break">and ML!</span></p>
			<p>This is also useful <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>for keeping an eye on trends and topics of discussion within communities. For instance, if there is a big data science conference coming up, there will suddenly be a lot of chatter on the topic, probably sharing similar hashtags. These hashtags can also be found by creating user-hashtag networks rather than user-user networks. This is excellent for watching trends come and go, especially if you add a time element to your <span class="No-Break">network data.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Mapping literary social networks</h2>
			<p>Another <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>one of my favorite uses of networks is to take a literary piece, such as <em class="italic">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland </em>or <em class="italic">Animal Farm,</em> and map out the social network of the book. I will discuss this in detail as part of this book. It is a bit more involved than what I do for social media, as the previous technique can be done with regex alone, and this technique requires NLP part-of-speech tagging or named-entity recognition. However, as a result, you end up with a social network of any piece of text that you can visually inspect to gain a better understanding of how <span class="No-Break">characters interact.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Mapping historical social networks</h2>
			<p>You <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>can also use NLP (part-of-speech tagging and named-entity recognition) approaches to map out historical social networks, as long as you have text about an event or some kind of data that shows relationships between people. For instance, it is simple to build the social network of the entire Bible by doing what I described with literary social networks. There is quite a lot of cleanup involved, but the results are breathtaking if you are thorough. I would love to see researchers do this with other historical texts, as it may give us additional insights that we have never <span class="No-Break">discovered before.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Mapping language</h2>
			<p>Another cool <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>use for networks is mapping language itself. This is something I discovered while playing around with the book <em class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</em> by Jane Austin. I wanted to see what would happen if I built a network of the interactions between every word in every sentence of her book. For instance, let's take the following sentence from <em class="italic">Pride </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">and Prejudice</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
			<p>Let’s map<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> this out using word sequence for setting up word relationships. If a word follows another word, then we say that there is a relationship between the two. Think of a relationship as an invisible line connecting two things. For the previous quote, we could map it out <span class="No-Break">as such:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>it -&gt; <span class="No-Break">is</span></li>
				<li>is -&gt; a</li>
				<li>a -&gt; <span class="No-Break">truth</span></li>
				<li>truth -&gt; <span class="No-Break">universally</span></li>
				<li>universally -&gt; <span class="No-Break">acknowledged</span></li>
				<li>acknowledged -&gt; <span class="No-Break">that</span></li>
				<li>that -&gt; a</li>
				<li>a -&gt; <span class="No-Break">single</span></li>
				<li>single -&gt; <span class="No-Break">man</span></li>
				<li>man -&gt; <span class="No-Break">in</span></li>
				<li>in -&gt; <span class="No-Break">possession</span></li>
				<li>possession -&gt; <span class="No-Break">of</span></li>
				<li>of -&gt; a</li>
				<li>a -&gt; <span class="No-Break">good</span></li>
				<li>good -&gt; <span class="No-Break">fortune</span></li>
				<li>fortune -&gt; <span class="No-Break">must</span></li>
				<li>must -&gt; <span class="No-Break">be</span></li>
				<li>be -&gt; <span class="No-Break">in</span></li>
				<li>in -&gt; <span class="No-Break">want</span></li>
				<li>want -&gt; <span class="No-Break">of</span></li>
				<li>of -&gt; a</li>
				<li>a -&gt; <span class="No-Break">wife</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In networks, we <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>call the connections between <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>nodes <strong class="bold">edges</strong>. <strong class="bold">Nodes</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>the things that we are connecting. In this case, this is a word network, so words are nodes, and the connections between words are called edges. You can think of edges as lines between <span class="No-Break">two things.</span></p>
			<p>In the quoted sentence, you may notice that <strong class="source-inline">a</strong> has an edge with <strong class="source-inline">truth</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">single</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">good</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">wife</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">in</strong> also has two edges, with <strong class="source-inline">possession</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">want</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Here is another example using a song by the <span class="No-Break">Smashing Pumpkins:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage.</p>
			<p>You could also map it out <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>despite -&gt; <span class="No-Break">all</span></li>
				<li>all -&gt; <span class="No-Break">my</span></li>
				<li>my -&gt; <span class="No-Break">rage</span></li>
				<li>rage -&gt; i</li>
				<li>i -&gt; <span class="No-Break">am</span></li>
				<li>am -&gt; <span class="No-Break">still</span></li>
				<li>still -&gt; <span class="No-Break">just</span></li>
				<li>just -&gt; a</li>
				<li>a -&gt; <span class="No-Break">rat</span></li>
				<li>rat -&gt; <span class="No-Break">in</span></li>
				<li>in -&gt; a</li>
				<li>a -&gt; <span class="No-Break">cage</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The letter <strong class="source-inline">a</strong> has an edge with both <strong class="source-inline">rat</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">cage</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>If you do this with an entire book, you end up with a super-dense network, and it is nearly worthless to visualize it; however, analyzing the network is not worthless. If you look at the outer nodes of <em class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</em>, you will find Jane Austin’s least used words, which often make an amazing vocabulary list. If you look at the core words, they are typically bridge words, such as “a,” “the,” <span class="No-Break">and “of.”</span></p>
			<p>I also used this <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>same technique for some research to see whether I could visually tell the difference between AI-generated text and human-generated text. Guess what? You can. If you use ML to generate text, it will choose the next word not because it is the most fitting but because it has the highest probability of being used. That’s great when you are trying to predict the next word in the sentence “Jack and Jill went up the ______”, but that is not great when you actually want to use it to create something truly original. We, humans, are more nuanced. If I wanted to transform that sentence into something really morbid, I could complete the sentence with the word “chimney.” I really doubt ML would <span class="No-Break">choose chimney.</span></p>
			<p>And visually, the networks look different between AI-generated text and human-generated text. When I did this back in 2019, the AI-generated network looked really jagged on the outside, with a much denser core, because it would choose higher-probability words. With humans, we are more nuanced, and the outer edge appeared softer. I was able to tell the difference between the two visually. Would more recent AI appear different? I encourage you to try this out if it <span class="No-Break">interests you.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Mapping dark networks</h2>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>last one is a bit dark. Sometimes, when bad things happen in the world, I want to know what groups of people are planning. Dark networks are social networks of people who wish to do others harm, but there are different kinds of dark networks (related to crime, terror, hate, drugs, and so on). Even dangerous people will rally around certain social media hashtags, so they occasionally hint at what is about to happen. I will not go into great detail on the level of intelligence that can be gathered, but you can do what I discussed under <em class="italic">Mapping community interactions</em> and use that to keep an eye on things or find other people of interest. You can also use that to report social media posts that violate community guidelines and even escalate to law enforcement if you see something specific. Just know that if you do this kind of <strong class="bold">Open Source Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSINT</strong>) gathering, it can have a nasty effect on your <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>mood and mental health, so tread lightly. However, it can also be <span class="No-Break">excellent research.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">When I am using this for OSINT, I typically start with a few people or things of interest and then gradually map out the social network that exists around them. However, this is not limited to dark networks. You could use this same technique for offense, defense, or just to follow your own curiosity. It is one useful way to study the interactions between people <span class="No-Break">and organizations.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">There are many uses for OSINT, and entire books have been written on the subject. However, the goal of OSINT is to use publicly available data to better understand or monitor something. For instance, you could use OSINT to research a company that you were interviewing at. Who is the owner? Who is interviewing me? Has the company been in the news? Was it a positive or negative story? What is the general consensus of the public about this company? Is it a legitimate company? What are ex-employees saying about it? What do they say on social media? Are most comments positive, negative, or neutral? There is so much you can learn about anything with the right set of questions and access to <span class="No-Break">the internet.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Market research</h2>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>consider a hypothetical situation: you have created a new product and would like to identify people who may find your product useful. I have done exactly this for my <span class="No-Break">own needs.</span></p>
			<p>I have used social network analysis to build a map of people who are part of a community and have used the results for market research. For one topic of interest, I can see thousands of researchers from around the world, and if I were to create a product for that community, it would take little work to develop an outreach campaign that would effectively drive interest in my product. For this, I only used Twitter data and was able to identify thousands of people I may want to approach after only a few days of scraping <span class="No-Break">and analysis.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Finding specific content</h2>
			<p>This part is kind of a<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> chicken-and-egg scenario. You need social media text in order to extract the social network data that exists in the text, and then you can use the social network to identify other accounts to scrape, further improving your data feeds. This is an iterative process. Identify, scrape, analyze, identify, scrape, analyze, and so on. You can further improve the analysis part by building NLP classifiers off the text you have scraped. Social network analysis will help you find important accounts, but your NLP classifiers will help you filter the noise to get relevant and <span class="No-Break">focused content.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Creating ML training data</h2>
			<p>As mentioned, you<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> can use the data feeds you scrape to create NLP classifiers, and you can use those classifiers to help you filter out noise, resulting in more focused content. You can then use that focused content to build even better classifiers. However, you must first create your initial classifiers, and the feeds that you create using a combination of NLP and network analysis will give you the rich, filtered data that you need to create useful training data. There is a process to this. It is time-consuming and takes a lot of work. I will explain this in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span>, <em class="italic">Networks and Supervised </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Machine Learning</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Specific and focused content feeds into classification training data, and trained classifiers will help identify additional <span class="No-Break">useful content.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Advanced network use cases</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B17105_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Natural Language Processing</em>, I specified several advanced use cases for NLP, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>language translation and text generation. However, while thinking about network analysis, my mind immediately asked, what would an advanced network use case even mean? This is all pretty advanced stuff. With NLP, you have simple tasks, such as tokenization, lemmatization, and simple sentiment analysis (positive or negative, hate speech or not hate speech), and you have advanced tasks. With networks, I can think of three potentially advanced <span class="No-Break">use cases:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Graph ML</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Knowledge graphs</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Recommendation systems</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, I don’t <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>think of any of them as all that advanced. I think of them as just having different implementations from other things I have mentioned. Furthermore, just because something is more technically challenging does not make it advanced or more important. In fact, if it is more difficult and returns less useful results, that’s not ideal. That’s a <span class="No-Break">time sink.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Graph ML</h2>
			<p>I have worked on <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>graph ML projects and have primarily found that there are two approaches: use graph measures (centralities, local clustering coefficients, and so on) as features in training data or feed graph representation data directly to ML and let it figure things out. Graph metadata can be a powerful enrichment for your training data as it can give an additional perspective for a model to hook into, so I think this is <span class="No-Break">really promising.</span></p>
			<p>However, in the past, when I have seen people attempting to use graph data directly in ML, often the graph knowledge was absent or weak. I wouldn’t recommend this approach until you are comfortable doing network analysis and ML separately. In ML, input data is easily as important (or more) than the model itself, so knowledge of networks should be present, but that is not always the case. Domain knowledge is important in data science. However, it is still extremely interesting stuff, so definitely check <span class="No-Break">it out.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Recommendation systems</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Recommendation systems</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> interesting, though I haven’t spent much time researching them; one concept is that if two people like <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>similar things, they may also like other things that neither yet have in common. For instance, if you and I both like the bands Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, and Nirvana, and I like The Breeders, and you like Stone Temple Pilots, it is quite likely that I’ll also like Stone Temple Pilots and you’ll also like The Breeders. If you want to explore recommendation systems, I encourage you to dive into the research. It’s just not one of my interests, as I primarily use networks for social network analysis, market research, <span class="No-Break">and OSINT.</span></p>
			<p>However, there are downsides to recommendation systems that I would like to point out. These systems recommend things that we would probably like, but the results aren’t usually all that unexpected. Musically, it makes sense that I would probably like Stone Temple Pilots and that you’d like The Breeders, but I am personally more excited when I fall in love with something completely unexpected. I am hopeful that in the future, our<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> recommendation systems will recommend food, music, and TV shows to us that we would not discover otherwise. I don’t want to live my life only experiencing similar things. I want the unexpected, <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>Also, when<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> we are only given things that we expect, we often end up reinforcing not-so-great things. For instance, if social media companies only show us stories that they think that we would like to see or that we are likely to engage with, we end up in an echo chamber, and this causes us to primarily associate with people who are just like us, who talk about the same things, and who agree upon the same things. That’s neither educational nor constructive. That causes polarization and can even lead to violence. It becomes a dangerous problem when people will only associate with those who are just like them and when they begin to demonize others who disagree with them, yet this happens all the time, and we <span class="No-Break">are susceptible.</span></p>
			<p>I’ll leave it up to you to decide what is a common versus advanced use of networks. In my mind, they’re all advanced, the implementation might just <span class="No-Break">be different.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Getting started with networks</h1>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>want to jump into your first original network analysis project, you need to first think up something that you are curious about. With social network analysis, you are often looking to build a sociogram, a visual map of how humans interact. So, for your first network project, you could ask something such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>How do the characters from &lt;book&gt; interact with <span class="No-Break">each other?</span></li>
				<li>Do the different animals in the book <em class="italic">Animal Farm</em> only interact with the same type of animals? Do humans only interact with certain types of animals, or do they interact with all types <span class="No-Break">of animals?</span></li>
				<li>What does the Twitterverse of my own town <span class="No-Break">look like?</span></li>
				<li>What does a network visualization of ingredients to meals look like? How does this differ for different regions in the world? What does a network visualization of ingredients to region <span class="No-Break">look like?</span></li>
				<li>What does the Twitter social network that exists around a certain politician look like? What does the friend map look like? What does the enemy map <span class="No-Break">look like?</span></li>
				<li>If I build an example dark network, what would be the optimal way to shatter it into pieces irreparably so that it would never be able to re-form if under <span class="No-Break">constant attack?</span></li>
				<li>If I build a network of my own infrastructure, and if I were to identify the structural weaknesses that could cause it to shatter into pieces if exploited, how could I best protect it now to prevent those types of attacks from disrupting <span class="No-Break">the network?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>And these <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>are just a few that I thought up in the last few minutes. The more you experiment and play with networks, the easier it will become for you to come up with your own research ideas, so just start with something simple and then become more ambitious over time. Some of these probably sound pretty complicated, but as long as you can get the data that you need, the network construction, analysis, and visualization are really not too difficult and have a lot <span class="No-Break">of overlap.</span></p>
			<p>In short, you need to find something that you are interested in and identify a relationship between those things. This could be as simple as who knows who, who likes who, who trusts who, who hates who, who works with who, what ingredients go into what meals, what infrastructure communicates with other infrastructure, what websites link to other websites, or what database tables can join against other <span class="No-Break">database tables.</span></p>
			<p>For my own independent research, I typically use Twitter data, as in my opinion, it is an NLP and network goldmine. And much of my work follows a <span class="No-Break">repeatable process:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Come up with a <span class="No-Break">research topic.</span></li>
				<li>Find a few Twitter accounts that are related to <span class="No-Break">that topic.</span></li>
				<li>Scrape <span class="No-Break">the accounts.</span></li>
				<li>Analyze the <span class="No-Break">scraped data:</span><ul><li>Extract <span class="No-Break">network data.</span></li><li>Extract additional users <span class="No-Break">to scrape.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">steps 3 and 4</em> as far as you want <span class="No-Break">to go.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>mentioned, it’s repeatable. I’ll explain how to get started with scraping in <a href="B17105_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor228"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>,<em class="italic"> Graph Construction and Cleaning</em>, and <a href="B17105_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor261"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Whole Network Analysis</em>. Once you learn how to get data via scraping <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>and <strong class="bold">Application Programming Interfaces </strong>(<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>), you will have access to more data than you can ever use. And for social network analysis, you will be able to follow the preceding example. Go slowly, and it will eventually <span class="No-Break">become natural.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Example – K-pop implementation</h2>
			<p>My<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> daughters are into K-pop music. Frequently, during dinner, I’d hear about groups such as BLACKPINK, TWICE, and BTS, and I had no idea what my girls were talking about. Then, one day, I was trying to think up a topic of research for my LinkedIn challenge <em class="italic">#100daysofnetworks</em>, and I thought I should do something with K-pop, as I could relate with my daughters if I knew a bit more about it, and it’d give me a way to show my daughters a little more about data science. So, I came up with a process to turn this idea into <span class="No-Break">a reality:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">I decided that I wanted to do some research into what the social network looked like around many of the most famous K-pop artists, and this should include music hubs and <span class="No-Break">fan clubs.</span></li>
				<li>I did about 30 minutes of Twitter lookups, hoping to identify a couple of dozen K-pop groups, music hubs, and fan clubs. I found about 30 of them and wrote them in <span class="No-Break">a notebook.</span></li>
				<li>I added these 30 accounts to my Twitter scraper and then combined the data into a feed, <strong class="source-inline">kpop.csv</strong>. This makes it much easier for me to do all of my network data extraction and then analysis, with everything in one file. My scrapers run 24/7/365, so I always have fresh data available <span class="No-Break">to explore.</span></li>
				<li>After getting a few days’ worths of scraped data, I analyzed the feed, extracted network data (user mentions and hashtags), and identified a couple dozen more accounts <span class="No-Break">to scrape.</span></li>
				<li>I repeated <em class="italic">steps 3 and 4</em> for about a month, and I now have a nice Twitter-centric social network of K-pop artists, music hubs, and <span class="No-Break">fan clubs.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>And now<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> that I am currently actively scraping 97 K-pop-related accounts, I have fresh new media all the time for my daughters to enjoy, and I have interesting network data to use for further improving <span class="No-Break">my skill.</span></p>
			<p>So, for your own network research, find something that you are interested in and then get to work. Choose something that you are interested in. Research should not be boring. This book will show you how to take your research curiosity and turn it into results. We will go into graph construction, analysis, and visualization after we get through the next couple <span class="No-Break">of chapters.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>We covered a lot of material in this short chapter. We discussed the confusion around the word <em class="italic">network</em>, went into the history and origins of graph theory, social network analysis, and network science, discussed resources for learning and practice, discussed some of my favorite network use cases, and finished by explaining how you can start formulating your own <span class="No-Break">network research.</span></p>
			<p>I hope this chapter gave you a rough idea of what all of this network stuff is. I know I did not go into great detail on the origins, and I mostly talked about social network analysis, but that is because that is my area of interest. I hope you now understand what networks can be used for, and I hope you understand that I have only scratched the surface. My goal was to ignite <span class="No-Break">your curiosity.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, I will explain the tools used for NLP. We are going to gradually move past theory and into <span class="No-Break">data science.</span></p>
