			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Useful Python Libraries</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, I’m going to introduce several of the Python libraries we will be using in this book. I will<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> describe what they are and how to install them, and give examples of a few useful things you can do with them. You do not have to memorize all of the capabilities of every Python library that you use, or thoroughly understand the internals of every single function that you use. It is important that you understand what libraries are available, what overall capabilities they have, and what critically important timesavers are in the library (this will keep you coming back for more). Everyone’s use case is different, and there is no way to memorize everything. I recommend that you internalize this point as quickly as possible, and learn what you need to when you need it. Learn about the internals in as much depth as <span class="No-Break">you need.</span></p>
			<p>To keep this organized, I am separating software libraries by category. Here are the libraries we <span class="No-Break">will discuss:</span></p>

			<p>It’s useful to <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>break the libraries down this way, as it is logical. We need to first collect, process, and analyze data before we should do anything else. We should visualize the data as we analyze it. Certain libraries specialize in NLP. Other libraries specialize in network analysis and visualization. Finally, there are different libraries that are useful for different kinds of ML, and even non-ML-focused libraries often have ML capabilities, such <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>I am going to keep this very high level, as we will actually be using these libraries in upcoming chapters. This chapter covers the “what” and “why” questions about given libraries. Other chapters will cover how they may <span class="No-Break">be used.</span></p>
			<p>One final point before moving on: you do not need to memorize every aspect of any of these Python libraries. In software development and data science, skills are acquired piece by piece. Learn what is useful to you now, then if a library proves to be useful, learn more. Don’t feel guilty for only knowing small pieces. Knowledge is accumulated over time, not all <span class="No-Break">at once.</span></p>
			<p>Our sections for this chapter will be <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Using notebooks</span></li>
				<li>Data analysis <span class="No-Break">and processing</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Data visualization</span></li>

			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>This chapter will deal with a lot of the resources we will be using throughout <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<p>All of the code can be found in the GitHub <span class="No-Break">repository: </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Network-Science-with-Python"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Network-Science-with-Python</span><span class="No-Break">.</span><span id="_idTextAnchor083"/></a></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Using notebooks</h1>
			<p>It is often easiest – and very useful – to do data analysis and prototyping using what we often <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>affectionately just call <strong class="bold">notebooks</strong>. <strong class="bold">Jupyter</strong> defines<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> the Jupyter notebook as a web-based interactive computing platform. I like that simple definition. Notebooks are essentially a series of “cells” that can contain code or text, which can be run individually or sequentially. This allows you to write code in a web browser, run the code while in the web browser, and see immediate results. For data analysis or experimentation, this immediate feedback <span class="No-Break">is useful.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, we use<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> Jupyter Notebook. I recommend downloading and installing it from the Anaconda website. You can do so <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.anaconda.com"><span class="No-Break">https://www.anaconda.com</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In Jupyter, you can run code and see the immediate results of that code, whether the output be text, numeric, or a data visualization. You will see a lot of notebook use in this book, so I will keep <span class="No-Break">this short.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Google Colab</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker169"/> another option for working with notebooks, and you don’t have to install anything to use it. This can be an even easier way to work with notebooks, but it has its advantages and disadvantages. I recommend that you learn how to use both and choose the one that you like best, or that allows you to work well <span class="No-Break">with others.</span></p>
			<p>You can check <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>out Google Colab <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://colab.research.google.com"><span class="No-Break">https://colab.research.google.com</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Next, let’s explore the libraries we’ll use for <span class="No-Break">data anal<a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>ysis.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Data analysis and processing</h1>
			<p>There are a <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>number of useful libraries for working with data, and you will want to use different libraries and techniques at different points of the data life cycle. For instance, in working with data, it is often useful to start with <strong class="bold">Exploratory Data Analysis</strong> (<strong class="bold">EDA</strong>). Later <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>on, you will want to do cleanup, wrangling, various transformations for preprocessing, and so on. Here are some of the available Python libraries and <span class="No-Break">thei<a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>r uses.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>pandas</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>easily<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> one of the most important libraries to use when doing anything with data in Python. Put simply, if you work with data in Python, you should know about <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, and you should probably be using it. You can use it for several different things when working with data, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reading data from an assortment of file types or from <span class="No-Break">the internet</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">EDA</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Extract, Transform, </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Load</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ETL</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>Simple and quick <span class="No-Break">data visualizations</span></li>
				<li>And much, <span class="No-Break">much, more</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If there is one Python library that I would recommend to everyone on this planet – not just data professionals – it is <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>. Being able to make short work of data analysis outside of spreadsheets is liberating <span class="No-Break">and <a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>powerful.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>If you’re<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> working in Jupyter or Google Colab notebooks, it’s very likely that <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> is already installed and that you can just start using it. However, if you need to follow the steps, you can follow the official installation <span class="No-Break">guide: </span><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html"><span class="No-Break">https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Once it is installed, or <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>if you suspect it is already installed, simply run this statement in your <span class="No-Break">favorite notebook:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import pandas as pd</pre>
			<p>If Python doesn’t complain about the library not being installed, you are <span class="No-Break">all set.</span></p>
			<p>If you want to see what version of <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> you are using, run <span class="No-Break">this statement:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
pd.__version__</pre>
			<p>I can see that I am running <span class="No-Break">vers<a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>ion 1.3.4.</span></p>
			<h3>Starter functionality</h3>
			<p>Reading <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>data is my preferred way to help people get started with <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>. After all, data work is pretty boring if you don’t have any data to play with. In <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, you typically work with a DataFrame, which resembles a data table or spreadsheet. A <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> DataFrame is a data object consisting of rows <span class="No-Break">and columns.</span></p>
			<p>To read a CSV file into a <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> DataFrame, you would do something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
data = 'data/fruit.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(data)</pre>
			<p>The data that I want to use is in a subdirectory of the current directory called data, in a file <span class="No-Break">called </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">fruit.csv</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Once it’s read into a DataFrame, you can preview <span class="No-Break">the data:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
df.head()</pre>
			<p>This will show a preview of the first five rows of <span class="No-Break">the DataFrame.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer035" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_03_002.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Simple pandas DataFrame" width="272" height="320"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – Simple pandas DataFrame</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>also read other datasets into <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>. For instance, if you already have <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> installed, you could <span class="No-Break">do this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
df = pd.DataFrame(iris['data'], columns=iris['feature_names'])
df.head()</pre>
			<p>That gives us <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 3</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.3</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer036" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_03_003.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – pandas DataFrame of the iris dataset" width="898" height="292"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – pandas DataFrame of the iris dataset</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> doesn’t only read from CSV files. It is quite versatile, and it is also less error-prone than other ways of loading CSV files. For instance, I often find that <strong class="bold">Spark</strong> glitches <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>out when reading CSV files, while <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> will have <span class="No-Break">no problem.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">What is Spark?</p>
			<p class="callout">Spark is a<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> technology that is often used for processing large amounts of data. Spark is very useful for “big data” workloads. At a certain point, large amounts of data can become too much for tools such as <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, and it is useful to know more powerful tools, such <span class="No-Break">as Spark.</span></p>
			<p>Here are some of the other <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">read_*</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> functions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_clipboard()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_excel()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_feather()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_fwf()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_gbq()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_hdf()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_html()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_json()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_orc()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_parquet()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_pickle()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_sas()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_spss()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_sql()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_sql_query()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_sql_table()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_stata()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_table()</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pd.read_xml()</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This looks <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>like a lot, and I personally do not have all of these memorized. I typically only use a handful of these, such as <strong class="source-inline">read_csv</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">read_json</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">read_parquet</strong>, but <strong class="source-inline">read_html</strong> is occasionally useful at a pinch <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>For me, EDA and simple visualizations are what got me hooked on <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>. For instance, if you wanted to draw a histogram, you could <span class="No-Break">do this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
df['petal width (cm)'].plot.hist()</pre>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer037" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_03_004.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – Petal width histogram" width="753" height="462"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – Petal width histogram</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> can<a id="_idIndexMarker182"/> do much more than what I’ve shown. There are countless blog posts and books on doing data analysis with <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>. Whole books have been written about using <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>. I encourage you to buy a few and learn as much about this library as you can. The more you learn about <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, the better you will be at work<a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>ing <span class="No-Break">with data.</span></p>
			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker183"/> learn more about <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> by visiting this <span class="No-Break">website: </span><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html"><span class="No-Break">https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>You can use this book as a reference to get more comfortable working with <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, but there are also several online guides that will give hands-on practice, such as <span class="No-Break">this: </span><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html"><span class="No-Break">https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_tabl<span id="_idTextAnchor092"/>e_oriented.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>NumPy</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">NumPy</strong> (<strong class="bold">Numeric Python</strong>) advertises<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> itself <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>as the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, and I can’t argue with that. Where <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> is excellent for doing data analysis against DataFrames, <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong> is more general-purpose and consists of a wide variety of mathematical functions <span class="No-Break">and transformations.</span></p>
			<p>But what’s the difference between it and <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>? That’s actually a good question because both libraries are often used together. Where you see <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, you will often also see <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong>. After several years of using both, the way things typically happen is I’ll try to do something in <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, find out that it’s not possible, and then find out that it’s possible in <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong>. The two libraries work well together, and they meet <span class="No-Break">different needs.</span></p>
			<p>With <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, it’s always exciting to read a CSV file for the first time and plot a histogram. With <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong>, there’s no real exciting moment. It’s just useful. It’s a powerful and versatile tool, and it will save you in a pinch, 9 times out of 10, when <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> doesn’t do wha<a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>t you need <span class="No-Break">to do.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>As with <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, if you are<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> working from within a notebook environment, <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong> is probably already installed. However, if you need to follow the steps, you can follow the official installation <span class="No-Break">guide: </span><a href="https://numpy.org/install/"><span class="No-Break">https://n<span id="_idTextAnchor095"/>umpy.org/install/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Starter functionality</h3>
			<p>If you want to play <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>around with <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong> to get a feel for what it can do, please check out one of their quickstart tutorials, such as <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html">https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html</a>. In the tutorial, they explain some basic operations such as generating random numbers, reshaping arrays, printin<a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>g arrays, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>You can learn <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>a lot more about <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong> at <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/">https://numpy.org/doc/stable/</a>. In this book, we will rely on <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong> at a pinch, as I described previously, when <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> or another library is unable to do something that we need. Often, there is a simple solution in <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong>. So, keep an eye out for <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>our use of <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong>, and learn what the process <span class="No-Break">is doing.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s move on from analysis and processing to the libraries we’ll use for <a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>visualizing <span class="No-Break">our data.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Data visualization</h1>
			<p>There are several <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>Python libraries that can be used for data visualizations. <strong class="bold">Matplotlib</strong> is a good place to start, but other libraries such as <strong class="bold">Seaborn</strong> can create more attractive visualizations, and <strong class="bold">Plotly</strong> can create <span class="No-Break">inter<a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>active visualizations.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Matplotlib</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> Python library for data <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>visualization. That’s it. If you have data, <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> can probably be used to visualize it. The library is integrated directly into <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, so if you use <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, you likely also <span class="No-Break">use </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> has a very steep learning curve and is not intuitive at all. I consider it a necessary evil if you are learning about Python data science. No matter how much data visualization I do with <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong>, it never becomes easy, and I memorize very little. I say all of this not to badmouth <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong>, but so that you will not feel negativity toward yourself if you struggle with the library. We all st<a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>ruggle with <span class="No-Break">the library.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>As with <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">NumPy</strong>, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>are working from within a notebook environment, <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> is probably already installed. However, if you need to follow the steps, you can follow the official installation <span class="No-Break">guide: </span><a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/"><span class="No-Break">https://matplotlib.org/<span id="_idTextAnchor102"/>stable/users/installing/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p>If you<a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> use <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> to do data visualization, you are already using <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong>. For instance, in the <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> discussion, we used this code to plot <span class="No-Break">a histogram:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
df['petal width (cm)'].plot.hist()</pre>
			<p>Simple visualizations such as bar charts can easily be done. They’re most easily done directly <span class="No-Break">in </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, you could create a horizontal <span class="No-Break">bar chart:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 df['petal width (cm)'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(8,6)).invert_yaxis()</pre>
			<p>This would render a very simple <span class="No-Break">data visualization.</span></p>

			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> tutorials <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>section is probably the best place to start <span class="No-Break">learning: </span><a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/"><span class="No-Break">https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>However, we will be making a lot of use of <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> in this book, so you should pick up quite a bit of knowledge just from follo<a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>wing along <span class="No-Break">and practicing.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Seaborn</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Seaborn</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker196"/> essentially “pretty <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong>.” It is an extension of <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> and produces more attractive data visualizations. The downside is that some things that were not remotely intuitive in <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> are even less intuitive in <strong class="source-inline">Seaborn</strong>. It’s got a learning curve like <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong>, and the learning never sticks. I find myself googling the web every time I need to make <span class="No-Break">a visualization.</span></p>
			<p>However, once you begin figuring things out, it’s not so bad. You start to remember the headaches you overcame, and powering through difficult things that should be simple (such as resizing visualizations) becomes slightly less aggravating <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<p>The visualizations are aesthetically pleasing, much more than the <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> default. It’s a lot of fun to just look through the <strong class="source-inline">Seaborn</strong> catalog of <span class="No-Break">visualizations: </span><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/."><span class="No-Break">https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/.</span></a></p>
			<p>We will occasionally use <strong class="source-inline">Seaborn</strong> in this book, but we will mostly use <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">scikit-network</strong> for our visualizations. Do learn about the librar<a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>y, though. It <span class="No-Break">is important.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>I don’t remember <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>whether notebooks come with <strong class="source-inline">Seaborn</strong> installed. It wouldn’t surprise me if they do by now. However, if you need to install <strong class="source-inline">Seaborn</strong>, you can follow the official installation <span class="No-Break">guide: </span><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html"><span class="No-Break">https://seaborn<span id="_idTextAnchor107"/>.pydata.org/installing.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Starter functionality</h3>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Seaborn</strong> can <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>do what <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> can do, but better, and more prettily. For instance, let’s redo the histogram we previously created, and include<a id="_idIndexMarker199"/> the <strong class="bold">Kernel Density </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Estimate</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">KDE</strong></span><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import seaborn as sns
sns.histplot(df['petal width (cm)'], kde=True)</pre>
			<p>This produces <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>the <span class="No-Break">following graph:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer039" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_03_006.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – Seaborn petal width histogram with the KDE" width="763" height="468"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.6 – Seaborn petal width histogram with the KDE</p>
			<p>The best way to get started with Seaborn is to just jump in. Get some data, then try to visualize it. Look through their example gallery for something applicable to your data, and then try to build the same thing. Copy their code at first, an<a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>d experiment <span class="No-Break">with parameters.</span></p>
			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> learn more about <strong class="source-inline">Seaborn</strong> from their <span class="No-Break">websi<a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>te: </span><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/"><span class="No-Break">https://seaborn.pydata.org/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Plotly</h2>
			<p>To be honest, we <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>will not use <strong class="source-inline">Plotly</strong> very<a id="_idIndexMarker203"/> often in this book, but there is one chapter where we needed to use an interactive scatterplot, and <strong class="source-inline">Plotly</strong> had a visualization that was useful. However, it is still good to know about <strong class="source-inline">Plotly</strong>, as it can be a powerful tool when you need simple intractability for <span class="No-Break">data visualization.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Plotly</strong> advertises <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>that it makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. That’s it. It essentially does what <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Seaborn</strong> do but in an interactive way. Building interaction into <strong class="source-inline">Matplotlib</strong> is possible, but it is painful. With <strong class="source-inline">Plotly</strong>, it <a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>is easy and fast, and a joy <span class="No-Break">to do.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>To install <strong class="source-inline">Plotly</strong>, follow<a id="_idIndexMarker205"/> their official <span class="No-Break">guide: </span><a href="https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#installation"><span class="No-Break">https://plotly.com/p<span id="_idTextAnchor112"/>ython/getting-started/#installation</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Starter functionality</h3>
			<p>Their<a id="_idIndexMarker206"/> website has a very fun and interactive gallery to play with, to stimulate creative ideas. I recommend that you read through their getting started guide, and explore their <span class="No-Break">examples. </span><a href="https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/"><span class="No-Break">https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p>Now that we have covered some useful libraries for data visualization, let’s do the sam<a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>e but for NLP and working <span class="No-Break">with text.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>NLP</h1>
			<p>Moving on<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> from data visualization to NLP, there are also several Python libraries that will be helpful to us in processing text. Each library has unique offerings as well as strengths and weaknesses, <a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>and the documentation should <span class="No-Break">be read.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Natural Language Toolkit</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Natural Language Toolkit</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLTK</strong>) is a <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>Python library for working with natural language – language used by humans in our daily interactions and activities. <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong> is an older Python library, and it is often better to use other libraries such as <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong> for things that used to be done with <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong>, such as named-entity recognition or <span class="No-Break">part-of-speech tagging.</span></p>
			<p>However, just because it is older doesn’t mean that it is obsolete. It is still very useful for analyzing text data, and it provides more linguistic capabilities than libraries such <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Put simply, <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong> is a foundational library for doing NLP in Python, and you should not skip past it for<a id="_idTextAnchor118"/> more recent libraries <span class="No-Break">and approaches.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Setup</h2>
			<p>Installing <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>easy. Just follow the <span class="No-Break">g<a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>uide: </span><a href="https://www.nltk.org/install.html"><span class="No-Break">https://www.nltk.org/install.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Starter functionality</h2>
			<p>We’re<a id="_idIndexMarker211"/> going to use <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong> quite a bit in this book. When you are ready, jump into the next chapter and we’ll get started right away. Nothing really stands out as exciting to show off as starter functionality. NLP becomes more exciting the more you learn. It is a bit confu<a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>sing in the beginning, to say <span class="No-Break">the least.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Documentation</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong> website <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>is not very helpful as a learning tool, but you can see some code snippets and examples <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://www.nltk.org"><span class="No-Break">https://www.nltk.org</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>These days, you will likely learn more about <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong> from blog posts (<em class="italic">TowardsDataScience</em> and others) than from the official <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong> website. Do a Google search for <strong class="source-inline">nltk getting started</strong> and you’ll find some helpful guides if you want to learn<a id="_idIndexMarker213"/> from <span class="No-Break">other sources.</span></p>
			<p>This book will be enough to help you get started with <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong>, but I do recommend learning from others who write about N<a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>LP. There is so much to learn <span class="No-Break">and explore.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>spaCy</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">spaCy</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker214"/> more recent Python library for NLP, and some of its<a id="_idIndexMarker215"/> functionality can serve as a replacement for things that used to be done in <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong>. For instance, if you are doing named-entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, or lemmatization, I recommend that you use <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong>, as it is quicker and simpler to get good results. However, the <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong> data loaders, stop words, tokenizers, and other linguistic offerings are still useful, and sometimes unmatched by <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong>. In my opinion, if you work with NLP in Python, you should learn about both <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong>, not just <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong>. Learn about both, and rem<a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>ember where <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong> shines brighter <span class="No-Break">than </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>To install <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong>, please<a id="_idIndexMarker216"/> use the official installa<a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>tion <span class="No-Break">guide: </span><a href="https://spacy.io/usage#quickstart"><span class="No-Break">https://spacy.io/usage#quickstart</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Starter functionality</h3>
			<p>You’re <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>going to see <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong> used quite a bit in this book, especially for named-entity recognition, which is useful in graph construction. Feel free to skip ahead if you want to see it <span class="No-Break">in use.</span></p>
			<p>As an example, let’s install the language model, <span class="No-Break">like so:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm</pre>
			<p>We can run <span class="No-Break">this code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("David Knickerbocker wrote this book, and today is September 4, 2022.")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)</pre>
			<p>And <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>this would output some <span class="No-Break">NER results:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">David Knickerbocker PERSON</strong>
<strong class="bold">today DATE</strong>
<strong class="bold">September 4, 2022 DATE</strong></pre>
			<p>How is it doing this, you mi<a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>ght wonder? It’s MAGIC! Just kidding – <span class="No-Break">it’s ML.</span></p>
			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>Unlike <strong class="source-inline">NLTK</strong>, the <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong> documentation<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> is thorough and helpful, and it looks modern. I recommend spending significant time on their website and learning about the capabilities. There is much more that can be done with <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong> than what we will cover in this book. To learn more, <span class="No-Break">vi<a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>sit </span><a href="https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features"><span class="No-Break">https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Network analysis and visualization</h1>
			<p>Our next <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>set of libraries is useful for analyzing and visualizing various types of networks. Network visualization is another form of data visualization but specifically for networks. It is very difficult and tedious to create useful network visua<a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>lizations without network <span class="No-Break">visualization software.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>NetworkX</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">NetworkX</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker221"/> incredibly <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>useful for doing social network analysis and network science using Python. Out of all of the Python libraries covered in this chapter, this library is the heart and soul of what you will be learning in this book. Everything revolves around <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong>, and there is simply no better resource for doing network analysis <span class="No-Break">in Python.</span></p>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>other libraries that can be used for very simple network visualization. In this book, I disregard all of those and show how <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">scikit-network</strong> can be used to both do good network analysis and make reasonably attractive <span class="No-Break">network visualizations.</span></p>
			<p>There are also other libraries that are useful alongside <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong>, for community detection, or for analyzing the fragility of networks, for instance, but <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> is the core. My goal for writing this book is to spread awareness of network science and using networks in software development, and <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> is crucial for this. I<a id="_idTextAnchor133"/> want more software engineers to learn <span class="No-Break">these skills.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>Please<a id="_idIndexMarker224"/> follow the official guide to installing <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong></span><span class="No-Break">: </span><a href="https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html"><span class="No-Break">h<span id="_idTextAnchor134"/>ttps://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Starter functionality</h3>
			<p>We’re going <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>to do a lot of really cool stuff with <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong>, but if you want to check that it is working, you can run <span class="No-Break">this code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import networkx as nx
G = nx.les_miserables_graph()
sorted(G.nodes)[0:10]</pre>
			<p>In a notebook, this should show a Python list of the first 10 nodes included in the <em class="italic">Les </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Miserables</em></span><span class="No-Break"> graph:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
['Anzelma',
 'Babet',
 'Bahorel',
 'Bamatabois',
 'BaronessT',
 'Blacheville',
 'Bossuet',
 'Boulatruelle',
 'Brevet',
 'Brujon']</pre>
			<p>Or, you<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> could do this, to get a quick summary of the <em class="italic">Les </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Miserables</em></span><span class="No-Break"> gra<a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>ph:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
print(nx.info(G))
Graph with 77 nodes and 254 edges</pre>
			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>The best way<a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> to learn about <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> is actually probably reading this book. There are very few books about using <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong>. There are some blog posts, and a few of the guides on the <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> website can be helpful. There’s this one, but it assumes that you have an understanding of <span class="No-Break">graphs: </span><a href="https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html"><span class="No-Break">https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The website does have very detailed documentation on the different tools <span class="No-Break">offered: </span><a href="https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/"><span class="No-Break">https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>My favorite part about their online resources is that they point to academic papers that were written about the functions that have been implemented. For instance, if you visit the page in the <strong class="bold">Link Prediction</strong> section about <strong class="bold">Preferential Attachment</strong>, you will see <span class="No-Break">this block:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_03_008.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8 – NetworkX reference" width="1264" height="189"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.8 – NetworkX reference</p>
			<p>On several occasions, I’ve enjoyed digging into the writing that has gone into the development of several algorithms. It is nice to know the background, and algorithms absolutely should not be used blindly. If you’re going to use<a id="_idTextAnchor136"/> a tool, learn how it works, and<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> where it <span class="No-Break">doesn’t work.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>scikit-network</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">scikit-network</strong> advertises<a id="_idIndexMarker229"/> itself as <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>a Python package for the analysis of large graphs, but this is not accurate at all. It is a Python package that excels at the visualization of small to medium-sized graphs but has little usefulness outside of that. However, for network visualization, I have found nothing better. <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> visualizations are slow, to the point that I will not teach them. They take a long time to render, even on a small network, and their appearance is bland and basic. <strong class="source-inline">scikit-network</strong> visualizations load very fast, on the other hand, as they are rendered SVGs. The visualizations load at a reasonable speed, even if you have hundreds or thousands <span class="No-Break">of nodes.</span></p>
			<p>However, the notion that this is a package for the analysis of large graphs is not accurate at all. This is visualization software, at its core, even if it is capable of doing a bit more than that. It seems they have added some additional capabilities (such as <strong class="bold">Graph Neural Networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">GNNs</strong>)), but most documentation pages highlight visualization. Do take a look at their offerings on embeddings and community detection, though. It seems that they are working toward doing more th<a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>an network visualization and that the library <span class="No-Break">is evolving.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>To<a id="_idIndexMarker231"/> install <strong class="source-inline">scikit-network</strong>, please follow the official <span class="No-Break">guide: </span><a href="https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first_steps.html"><span class="No-Break">https<span id="_idTextAnchor139"/>://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first_steps.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Starter functionality</h3>
			<p>In this book, we<a id="_idIndexMarker232"/> will only use <strong class="source-inline">scikit-network</strong> for network visualization, so if you’d like to get started with it, please take a look at some of their tutorials, such as <a href="https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/visualization/graphs.html">https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/visualization/graphs.html</a>. There are sev<a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>eral tutorials you can use to learn more about <span class="No-Break">the library.</span></p>
			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">scikit-network</strong> documentation is pretty good and pretty well-organized. The<a id="_idIndexMarker233"/> simplicity of the documentation shows that it’s really not a very deep Python library. If you want to learn more, start <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><span class="No-Break">https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>You might be wondering why I only use this for visualization when it also offers capabilities for some ML, community detection, and other things. The reason is this: <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">KarateClub</strong> also offer similar capabilities, and they do them better. For instance, <strong class="source-inline">KarateClub</strong> offers <strong class="bold">Scalable Community Detection</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCD</strong>) as an approach for <strong class="bold">Graph Machine Community Detection</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> provides the <strong class="bold">Louvain method</strong>. While <strong class="source-inline">scikit-network</strong> provides functionality for calculating <strong class="bold">PageRank</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> does it better and <span class="No-Break">more cleanly.</span></p>
			<p>That is why I only show how it can be used for visualization. The other capabilities haven’t shown to be better than those provided by <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">KarateClub</strong>. It’s nothing personal. We all have our <span class="No-Break">favorite tools.</span></p>
			<p>In the ne<a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>xt section, we’ll talk about the libraries we can use <span class="No-Break">for ML.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>ML</h1>
			<p>There is also a set <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>of Python libraries for doing machine learning. Knowing the Python libraries and algorithms is not enough. Please learn as much as you can about the models and techniques you will use. There is always more to learn. Here are s<a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>ome of the libraries you will most likely <span class="No-Break">frequently use.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>scikit-learn</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">scikit-learn</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker235"/> powerhouse in ML in Python. There <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>are other important Python libraries for ML, such as <strong class="source-inline">TensorFlow</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">PyTorch</strong>, but we will not use them directly in this book. Just be aware that they are out there, and that you should learn about them as your ML <span class="No-Break">skills improve.</span></p>
			<p>If you are learning about or doing ML in Python, you will very quickly run into <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> provides a treasure trove of ML models, data loaders, preprocessors, transformations, and much more. There are many books and blog posts about <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong>, including several that have been published by Packt. If you are interested in learning ML, you will be doing a <a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>lot of reading, and <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> is an excellent place <span class="No-Break">to start.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>If you<a id="_idIndexMarker237"/> are working with notebooks, then <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> is probably already installed. However, if you need to install it, please follow <a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>the official <span class="No-Break">guide: </span><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html"><span class="No-Break">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Starter functionality</h3>
			<p>ML is<a id="_idIndexMarker238"/> complicated, and it takes several steps to build and use a model. For now, just make sure that <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> is installed and that you can see which version you <span class="No-Break">are running:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import sklearn
sklearn.__version__</pre>
			<p>For me, this shows that I am running version <strong class="source-inline">1.0.2</strong>. For the exercises in this book, we do not need to have an exact match, but for reproducibility in the real worl<a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>d, all versions of libraries should match when <span class="No-Break">deploying anything.</span></p>
			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>There<a id="_idIndexMarker239"/> are more resources for <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> than there are for probably every other Python library I’ve mentioned in this chapter. ML is a trendy topic, and there is a demand for books, blog posts, videos, and other instruction, so there is no shortage of resources to learn from. However, the <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> documentation is the place <span class="No-Break">to start.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> starter guide can be found <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html"><span class="No-Break">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The full user guide can be found at <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html</a>, and there is also an API reference <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html"><span class="No-Break">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>We will be doing a bit of supervised and unsupervised machine learning in this book, but we won’t go very far into the topic. There will be much more to learn if you are interested. This book will only <a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>scratch the surface of ML and hopefully will kick off <span class="No-Break">an obsession.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Karate Club</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Karate Club</strong> advertises<a id="_idIndexMarker240"/> itself as being an unsupervised machine learning extension library for <strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong>. In other words, <strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong> bridges <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>the gap between machine learning and graph analysis. It provides several useful unsupervised learning models that can be used for community detection as well as creating node embeddings from graphs that may be used in downstream supervised learning tasks. This is often referred to as graph machine learning, and there is a lot of excitement about using graphs and machine learning together, for instance, to predict new connections (who should be friends, who would like certain music or products, and <span class="No-Break">so on).</span></p>
			<p>What’s the difference between this and <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong>? Well, <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> can be used with any numeric data. <strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong> specializes in transforming graphs into numeric data through unsupervised machine learning. <strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong> outputs can be <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> inputs, but rarely the other <span class="No-Break">way around.</span></p>
			<p>For <strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong> to be useful, you need graphs (<strong class="source-inline">NetworkX</strong>) and you need ML (<strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">TensorFlow</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">PyTorch</strong>, and so on). <strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong> is not very useful <span class="No-Break">by itself.</span></p>
			<p>Karate <a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Club is not yet supported by higher versions of Python, such <span class="No-Break">as 3.10.</span></p>
			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>install <strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong>, follow the official <span class="No-Break">guid<a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>e: </span><a href="https://karateclub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html"><span class="No-Break">https://karateclub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Starter functionality</h3>
			<p>There’s no starter functionality worth showcasing. ML is complicated and takes several steps to be of use. For now, let’s just verify that the library is installed and that we can see the <span class="No-Break">version number:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import karatec<a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>lub
karateclub.__version__</pre>
			<p>I can see that I am running <span class="No-Break">version </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">1.3.0</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong> provides an introductory guide at <a href="https://karateclub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/introduction.html">https://karateclub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/introduction.html</a>. Here, you can start to see how<a id="_idIndexMarker243"/> the library may be used. You will also likely notice some references to other libraries, such <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong> has exemplary documentation. You can find it at <a href="https://karateclub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/root.html">https://karateclub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/root.html</a>. The thing that I love the most is that they cite the journal articles that were written about the models. For instance, if you look at the documentation for any of the algorithms, you will often find mention of the paper that was published about <span class="No-Break">the model.</span></p>

			<p>As I’ve looked through several of the <strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong> models for work in this book, I’ve had the opportunity to read many of these papers, and that has brought me many hours of enjoyment. I love this <span class="No-Break">so much.</span></p>
			<p>And if you are working with <strong class="source-inline">Karate Club</strong> in code, you can also see mention of the paper in notebooks if you <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">Tab</em> into a <span class="No-Break">function call:</span></p>

			<p>Not only is <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>this library exciting to use but it’s also educational to <span class="No-Break">learn from.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>spaCy (revisited)</h2>
			<p>Yes, I’m <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>mentioning <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong> again. Why? Because <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong> offers <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>several language models, and in many different languages. This means that you can use the <strong class="source-inline">spaCy</strong> pre-trained machine learning models for your own purposes, for instance, for named-entity recognition. Their models have already been trained and can be directly imported for <a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>use. You will learn how to do so in this book, in the next <span class="No-Break">few chapters.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>There are other Python libraries that we will use in this book, but they will be explained in their relevant chapters. In this chapter, I wanted to describe the primary libraries we will use for our work. In order to get to the really experimental stuff that we cover in this book, a foundation needs to be <span class="No-Break">in place.</span></p>
			<p>For instance, you need to be able to read and analyze tabular (structured) data. You also need to be able to visualize data. With text, you need to be able to convert text into a format that is ready for analysis and use. For graphs, you need to be able to do the same. And finally, if you want to apply machine learning to networks or text, you should understand how to <span class="No-Break">do that.</span></p>
			<p>That is why the sections have been broken down into data analysis and processing, data visualization, natural language processing, network analysis and visualization, and machine learning. I hope the <span class="No-Break">structure helps.</span></p>
			<p>With these libraries installed and briefly explained, we are now ready to get our hands dirty with network science, social network analysis, and NLP, all <span class="No-Break">in Python.</span></p>
