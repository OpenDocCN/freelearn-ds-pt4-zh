			<h1 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>Egocentric Network Analysis</h1>
			<p>The previous chapter was a whirlwind. We covered so much material, learning how to visualize and analyze whole networks. In comparison, this chapter should feel much simpler. It will also be much shorter. In previous chapters, we learned how to get and create network data, how to build graphs from network data, how to clean graph data, and how to do interesting things such as identifying communities. In this chapter, we will be doing what is <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>called <strong class="bold">egocentric </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">network analysis</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The good news is that everything that was learned in the previous chapter applies to egocentric networks. Centralities can be useful for finding important nodes. Community algorithms can be useful for identifying communities. The great news is that there really isn’t a lot that we need to cover in this chapter. Egocentric network analysis is simpler in scale as well as in scope. It’s most important that I explain how to get started, show what you can do, and explain future steps you might want to take to go further in your analysis. As with any kind of analysis, there is always more that you can do, but we will keep things very simple in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover the following topics in <span class="No-Break">the chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Doing egocentric <span class="No-Break">network analysis</span></li>
				<li>Investigating ego nodes <span class="No-Break">and connections</span></li>
				<li>Identifying other <span class="No-Break">research opportunities</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will mostly be using the Python libraries NetworkX and pandas. These libraries should be installed by now, so they should be ready for your use. If they are not installed, you can install Python libraries with <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
pip install &lt;library name&gt;</pre>
			<p>For instance, to install NetworkX, you would do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
pip install networkx</pre>
			<p>In <a href="B17105_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor158"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, we also introduced a <strong class="source-inline">draw_graph()</strong> function that uses both NetworkX and <strong class="source-inline">scikit-network</strong>. You will need that code any time that we do network visualization. You will need it for this chapter and most chapters in <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>The code is available on <span class="No-Break">GitHub: </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Network-Science-with-Python"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Network-Science-with-Python</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Egocentric network analysis</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Egocentric network analysis</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> form of network analysis that is useful for investigating the relationships that exist around a specific person in a social network. Rather than looking at the whole social network, we will zoom in on an individual and the individuals that this person interacts with. Egocentric network analysis uses<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> a simpler form of a network called an <strong class="bold">egocentric network</strong> (<strong class="bold">ego network</strong>). From this point on, I will refer to these networks as <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">ego networks</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In an ego network, there are two types of nodes: <strong class="bold">ego</strong> and <strong class="bold">alters</strong>. The ego node is the node of an individual <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>that you are investigating. Alters, on <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>the other hand, are all other nodes that exist in an ego network. If I were to make an ego network based on my own life, I would be the ego, and the people I know would be the alters. If I wanted to investigate the people who mention or are mentioned by the <strong class="bold">@spotifykr</strong> Twitter account in the K-pop social network from the previous chapter, I would create an ego network for spotifykr. spotifykr would be the ego, and all other nodes would <span class="No-Break">be altered.</span></p>
			<p>What’s the point of this? Well, you can learn a lot about a person or organization based on the people who interact with that person. Like attracts like, in many cases. In my own life, most of my friends are engineers or data scientists, but my other friends are artists. I enjoy knowing creative and analytical people. Someone else might have a completely different makeup of the types of people they hang out with. Analyzing and visualizing ego networks can give us insights into relationships that we may be unable to see or notice living in the moment. We may have a hunch that certain types of relationships exist or how a person is being influenced, but being able to analyze and visualize an ego network itself <span class="No-Break">is illuminating.</span></p>
			<p>One nice thing about working with ego networks rather than whole networks is that ego networks tend to be much smaller and less complex than whole networks. That makes sense, as ego networks are subsets of a larger ecosystem. For instance, in a social network of millions of people, an ego network will focus on the ego node, and the alter nodes that surround it. As these networks are much smaller and less complex, this can allow for easy work with otherwise computationally expensive algorithms. There’s <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>less data to crunch. However, ego networks obviously scale based on the popularity of an individual. The ego network for a celebrity influencer will be much more complex than my own ego network. I don’t have millions <span class="No-Break">of follow<a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>ers.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Uses for egocentric network analysis</h2>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>social network analysis, ego networks are used to understand the relationships and communities that exist around a person. However, that is not at all the limit of what you can do with ego network analysis. I have used ego networks in a variety of different kinds of work to understand people’s relationships, communication flow, and influence. I have also used networks to map out production data flows across a data center, and ego networks to investigate data flows and processes that exist around a piece of software or database table. If you can create a network, you can use ego networks to drill into the network for a closer look. You are not limited to analyzing people. You can use this to analyze families of malware, for instance. You can use this to understand how amplification works across social media. You can use this to inspect a component involved in a supply chain. You are limited by your own creativity and the data you are able to create or acquire. Anywhere that a network exists, ego networks can be used <span class="No-Break">for ana<a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>lysis.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Explaining the analysis methodology</h2>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>chapter is going to be completely hands-on and repeatable. We will use a pre-built NetworkX network of the characters involved in the novel <em class="italic">Les Miserables</em>. I chose to use this network because it is large and complex enough to be interesting, but also because it has clear communities that can be seen inside various ego networks. This is an excellent network for practice with social <span class="No-Break">network analysis.</span></p>
			<p>The NetworkX network comes with weights, which allow us to draw thicker edges between nodes that have more interactions than those that have fewer interactions. However, for this analysis, I have chosen to drop the weights, as I want you to pay most attention to the alters and communities that exist around an ego node. For this analysis, I am more interested in the structure of the ego network and the communities that exist inside the ego network. I do recommend that you challenge yourself. As you make your way through the code of this chapter, maybe keep the weights rather than dropping them, and see how it affects the <span class="No-Break">network visualizations.</span></p>
			<p>We will<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> start by doing a quick whole network spotcheck, just to see what the network looks like and to pick up centralities that could be useful for identifying interesting nodes that could use an ego <span class="No-Break">network analysis.</span></p>
			<p>After that, we’ll look at four separate ego networks. We will start by learning just a little bit about the ego character from the novel, but we will not go into depth. Then, we will visualize the ego network both with and without its center. In an ego network, if you drop the ego node, it’s called dropping the center. The ego node sits in the center. In an ego network, all alters have an edge between themselves and the ego node. If an alter is in an ego network, the alter has some form of relationship with the ego. So, what do you think will happen if you drop the ego node from an ego network? The ego network becomes simpler and may even break into pieces. This breakage is especially useful when it happens, as it becomes very easy to identify different communities, as they show as clusters of nodes. So, we will perform ego network analysis with the <span class="No-Break">center dropped.</span></p>
			<p>We will look to identify the alters that exist in an ego network, identify the most important alters, and we’ll compare the density of each of the four ego networks. We will also look for communities as well as bridges that exist <span class="No-Break">between communities.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s <span class="No-Break">get <a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>started!</span></p>
			<h3>Whole network spot check</h3>
			<p>Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>can do anything with ego networks, we must first construct our graph. We have done this several times by now, so this should be familiar territory, but this time, we are going to use one of NetworkX’s pre-built graphs. Loading a pre-built graph <span class="No-Break">is simple:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import networkx as nx
G = nx.les_miserables_graph()</pre>
			<p>NetworkX has several other graphs available, so be sure to browse the documentation as you may find other networks of interest for your own work <span class="No-Break">and learning.</span></p>
			<p>This graph contains edge weights. While this is useful for understanding the number of interactions that take place between nodes, I have chosen to remove it from our graph so that we have clearer lines and so that we can focus on the ego networks themselves. These <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>commands will convert the graph into a pandas edge list DataFrame – keeping only the source and target fields – and create a new graph using <span class="No-Break">the DataFrame:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
df = nx.to_pandas_edgelist(G)[['source', 'target']]
G = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df)</pre>
			<p>Now that our revised graph is built, we can take a look at the number of nodes <span class="No-Break">and edges:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
nx.info(G)
'Graph with 77 nodes and 254 edges'</pre>
			<p>With only <strong class="source-inline">77</strong> nodes and <strong class="source-inline">254</strong> edges, this is a simple network, and we can easily visualize it in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
draw_graph(G, font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>This produces the <span class="No-Break">following network:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer124" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_001.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1 – Les Miserables whole network" width="1650" height="1013"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.1 – Les Miserables whole network</p>
			<p>This is <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>good enough to move on, but I want to remind<a id="_idIndexMarker583"/> you of something we learned about in the previous chapter. We can use <strong class="source-inline">k_core</strong> to remove nodes from the visualization that have less than <strong class="source-inline">k</strong> nodes. In this case, I have chosen to not show nodes with fewer than <span class="No-Break">two nodes:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
draw_graph(nx.k_core(G, 2), font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>This will draw a network visualization, showing nodes that have two or more edges, effectively removing isolates and nodes with only a single edge. This will give us a quick understanding and preview of the structure of <span class="No-Break">our network:</span></p>
			<div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.2 – Les Miserables whole network (k=2)</p>
			<p>After<a id="_idIndexMarker584"/> visualizing a network, I tend to <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>collect the PageRank scores of all nodes on a network. PageRank is a fast algorithm that scales well regardless of network size, so this is a good go-to algorithm for quickly identifying node importance, as discussed in the previous chapter. As a reminder, the <strong class="source-inline">pagerank</strong> algorithm calculates an importance score based on the number of incoming and outgoing edges that a node has. For this network, we are using an undirected graph, so <strong class="source-inline">pagerank</strong> is really calculating the score based on the number of edges that a node has, as there is no such thing as <strong class="source-inline">in_degree</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">out_degree</strong> in an undirected network. Here is how we can calculate <strong class="source-inline">pagerank</strong> and put the scores into a pandas DataFrame for quick analysis <span class="No-Break">and visualization:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import pandas as pd
pagerank = nx.pagerank(G)
pagerank_df = pd.DataFrame(pagerank, index=[0]).T
pagerank_df.columns = ['pagerank']
pagerank_df.sort_values('pagerank', inplace=True, ascending=False)
pagerank_df.head(20)</pre>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>visualize the <strong class="source-inline">pagerank</strong> <span class="No-Break">algorithm calculation:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.3 – Top 20 PageRank nodes in the Les Miserables network</p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.4 – Top 20 PageRank nodes visualized in the Les Miserables network</p>
			<p>Excellent. We can clearly see that <strong class="bold">Valjean</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>very important character in this story. We will definitely want to inspect Valjean’s ego network, as well as the ego<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> networks of <strong class="bold">Myriel</strong> and <strong class="bold">Gavroche</strong>. In <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>an attempt to make sure that we don’t get too similar ego networks, I have chosen <strong class="bold">Joly</strong> as<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> the fourth character to inspect. Joly is much further down on the <span class="No-Break">PageRank list.</span></p>
			<p>This is all of the whole network analysis that we will be doing in this chapter. From this point on, we will be learning about ego net<a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>works. <span class="No-Break">Let’s go!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>Investigating ego nodes and connections</h1>
			<p>In egocentric <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>network analysis, we are interested in learning more about the communities that exist around a single node in a network. We are much less interested in<a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> the structure and makeup of the entire network. We are “zooming in,” so to speak. We will use egocentric network analysis to inspect the communities that exist around core characters fr<a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>om <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Les Miserables</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>Ego 1 – Valjean</h2>
			<p>According <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>to Wikipedia, Jean Valjean is the protagonist of Les Miserables. Knowing <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>this, it makes sense that Valjean has the highest PageRank score of all characters in the network. The main character of any story typically interacts with more characters than anyone else, and PageRank will reflect that. For the sake of this chapter, this is as much background digging as we will do per character. If you want to do a thorough analysis of the networks that exist in a piece of literature, you should go much deeper. In this chapter, I am most interested in showing how to wor<a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>k with <span class="No-Break">ego networks.</span></p>
			<h3>Full ego network</h3>
			<p>Before we can analyze an<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/> ego network, we must first create one. In NetworkX, this is called <strong class="source-inline">ego_graph</strong> and one can be created by simply passing in the full graph as well as the name of the node that you would like <span class="No-Break">to analyze:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ego_1 = nx.ego_graph(G, 'Valjean')</pre>
			<p>That’s it. That’s how to create an ego network. There are other parameters that you can pass in, but in practice, this is about as complicated as <span class="No-Break">it gets:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
draw_graph(ego_1, font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>We can now visualize the <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer128" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_005.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5 – The Valjean ego network" width="1650" height="941"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.5 – The Valjean ego network</p>
			<p>If you look closely, you<a id="_idIndexMarker597"/> should see that Valjean is in the center of his own ego network. This makes sense. The ego (Valjean) has some form of relationship with all of the alters (other nodes) that exist in the <span class="No-Break">ego network.</span></p>
			<p>Before moving on, there is something important that I want to point out. An ego network is just another network. Everything that we learned about in the previous chapter – <em class="italic">centralities</em>, <em class="italic">communities</em>, <em class="italic">degrees</em>, <strong class="source-inline">k_core</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">k_corona</strong> – also applies to ego networks. Consider that the previous chapter mentioned that certain centralities are computationally expensive and time-consuming to run against whole networks. That is not always or even usually the case for ego networks, in my experience. Algorithms that were impractical for whole networks can be useful on ego networks, and can be applied with ease. There is an overlap between what can be useful for whole network analysis and egocentric network analysis. Everything that we learned in the previous chapter can be app<a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>lied to <span class="No-Break">ego networks.</span></p>
			<h3>Dropping the center from an ego network</h3>
			<p>One <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>important option that is often overlooked is the ability to drop the center of an ego network. In simple terms, this means dropping Valjean out of his ego network. I find this very useful to do because when you drop a central node, often a network will shatter into pieces, making it much easier to identify the communities that exist in a network. We can drop the center out of an ego network <span class="No-Break">like so:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ego_1 = nx.ego_graph(G, 'Valjean', center=False)</pre>
			<p>Now, that we have removed the center node – the ego – let’s visualize the <span class="No-Break">network again:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
draw_graph(ego_1, font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer129" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_006.jpg" alt="Figure 8.6 – The Valjean ego network with the center dropped" width="1590" height="1062"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.6 – The Valjean ego network with the center dropped</p>
			<p>Compare this <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>visualization to the previous one. What do you see? I can see that there is one large cluster of nodes that seems to have at least two communities as part of it at the top and to the left. I can also see a community of three nodes that has split off as an island on the right. And finally, I can see four isolate nodes. I hope it’s clear to you that dropping the center can make it much easier to see <a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>these kinds <span class="No-Break">of things.</span></p>
			<h3>Ego network (dropped center, denoised)</h3>
			<p>I often use <strong class="source-inline">k_core</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>denoise a network, and the same can be done for ego networks. Let’s drop all nodes with less than one edge, effectively <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>dropping the four <span class="No-Break">isolate nodes:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
draw_graph(nx.k_core(ego_1, 1), font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>Now, let’s use the <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>preceding code to <span class="No-Break">visualize it:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer130" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_007.jpg" alt="Figure 8.7 – The Valjean ego network with the center and isolates dropped" width="1650" height="1013"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.7 – The Valjean ego network with the center and isolates dropped</p>
			<p>Now we have an<a id="_idIndexMarker603"/> even cleaner network, and it is clear that there are two clusters of nodes. A quick search on Wikipedia shows that <strong class="bold">Myriel</strong> is a bishop, <strong class="bold">Magloire</strong> is his servant and sister, and <strong class="bold">Baptistine</strong> is also his sister. It makes sense that they are par<a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>t of their <span class="No-Break">own community.</span></p>
			<h3>Alter list and amount</h3>
			<p>The same way we looked up nodes that exist in a whole network can also be used on an ego <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>network. Rather than <strong class="source-inline">G.nodes</strong>, we’ll use <strong class="source-inline">ego_1.nodes</strong>, as <strong class="source-inline">ego_1</strong> is our <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
sorted(ego_1.nodes)
['Babet', 'Bamatabois', 'Bossuet', 'Brevet', 'Champmathieu', 'Chenildieu', 'Claquesous', 'Cochepaille', 'Cosette', 'Enjolras', 'Fantine', 'Fauchelevent', 'Gavroche', 'Gervais', 'Gillenormand', 'Gueulemer', 'Isabeau', 'Javert', 'Judge', 'Labarre', 'Marguerite', 'Marius', 'MlleBaptistine', 'MlleGillenormand', 'MmeDeR', 'MmeMagloire', 'MmeThenardier', 'Montparnasse', 'MotherInnocent', 'Myriel', 'Scaufflaire', 'Simplice', 'Thenardier', 'Toussaint', 'Woman1', 'Woman2']</pre>
			<p>There are two different ways that we can get the number of alters that exist in the ego network. Remember, we dropped the center node (the ego), so all remaining nodes <span class="No-Break">are alters:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first method is just to simply count the number of nodes in <span class="No-Break">the network:</span><pre class="source-code">
len(ego_1.nodes)</pre><pre class="source-code">
36</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>That’s fine, but what if we want to see the number of edges <span class="No-Break">as well?</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Let’s just cut to the chase and use the <strong class="source-inline">nx.info()</strong> function instead of looking up how to get a list of all edges in a network, as this <span class="No-Break">is easier:</span><pre class="source-code">
nx.info(ego_1)</pre><pre class="source-code">
Graph with 36 nodes and 76 edges'</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The whole network had <strong class="source-inline">77</strong> nodes, so clearly, t<a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>he ego network <span class="No-Break">is simpler.</span></p>
			<h3>Important alters</h3>
			<p>Getting a list of<a id="_idIndexMarker605"/> alters is one thing, but it is more useful if we can get a list of alters accompanied by some relevant centrality score to be able to gauge the importance of individual nodes in a network. Remember, there is no one centrality score to rule them all. We could have used PageRank, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, or any of the other measures. These are the nodes that are connected to most other nodes in the <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
degcent = nx.degree_centrality(ego_1)
degcent_df = pd.DataFrame(degcent, index=[0]).T
degcent_df.columns = ['degree_centrality']
degcent_df.sort_values('degree_centrality', inplace=True, ascending=False)
degcent_df.head(10)</pre>
			<p>Let’s visualize <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>this and take a look at <span class="No-Break">our centralities:</span></p>

			<p>The other alters with<a id="_idIndexMarker607"/> the highest centralities are much more difficult to see. <strong class="bold">MmeThenardier</strong> is in the center<a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>, poking out on <span class="No-Break">the right.</span></p>
			<h3>Ego network density</h3>
			<p>Let’s wrap<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> up this ego network by getting the network density. Density has to do with the level of connectedness between all the nodes in a network. In order to have a density of <strong class="source-inline">1.0</strong>, every single node would have an edge with every single other node in a network. To have a density of <strong class="source-inline">0.0</strong>, a network would be made entirely of isolates, with no edges between any nodes. Can you guess roughly what the density would be for this network? It looks loosely connected to me, with a few pockets of densely connected communities. So, my guess would be a pretty low score. Let’s use NetworkX to calculate <span class="No-Break">the density:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
nx.density(ego_1)
0.12063492063492064</pre>
			<p>A density <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>of around <strong class="source-inline">0.12</strong> is a loosely connected network. I’ve calculated density because I want to use this to be able to compare the density of each of the <span class="No-Break">ego networks.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You might be wondering why we are looking at betweenness centrality and density or wondering what the relationship is between centrality and density. Centrality scores are useful for understanding the importance of a node in a network. Density tells us about the overall composition of the network. If a network is dense, then nodes are more connected than in a sparse network. Centrality and density scores are a way to get a quic<a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>k understanding of <span class="No-Break">a network.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>Ego 2 – Marius</h2>
			<p>Wikipedia<a id="_idIndexMarker610"/> lists Marius Pontmercy as another protagonist in the novel. Let’s <a id="_idTextAnchor335"/><a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>look at his ego <span class="No-Break">network next.</span></p>
			<h3>Full ego network</h3>
			<p>First, we’ll<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> construct the whole ego network without dropping <span class="No-Break">the center:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ego_2 = nx.ego_graph(G, 'Marius')
draw_graph(ego_2, font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>Next, we’ll visualize the whole <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer133" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_010.jpg" alt="Figure 8.10 – Marius’ ego network" width="1650" height="1013"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.10 – Marius’ ego network</p>
			<p>Perfect. One <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>thing is clear: this ego network looks completely different than Valjean’s. Looking at the bottom left, I can see a densely connected community of individuals. Looking to the right, I can see a character that <strong class="bold">Marius</strong> has fon<a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>d feelings for, but <span class="No-Break">no spoilers.</span></p>
			<h3>Ego network (dropped center)</h3>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>drop the center (ego) out of this network and see how <span class="No-Break">it looks:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ego_2 = nx.ego_graph(G, 'Marius', center=False)
draw_graph(ego_2, font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>This will draw our <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer134" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_011.jpg" alt="Figure 8.11 – Marius’ ego network with the center dropped" width="1650" height="1013"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.11 – Marius’ ego network with the center dropped</p>
			<p>Dropping the <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>center also has drastically different results than when we did it for Valjean’s ego network. In Valjean’s case, four isolates detached from the network. In Marius’ ego network, even with the center dropped, there are no isolates. The members of his ego network are connected well enough that removing Marius’ node did not break the network apart. This network <span class="No-Break">is resilient.</span></p>
			<p>The densely connected community that exists in this ego network is also easily visible on the right. I can also see Valjean near the center of <span class="No-Break">the network.</span></p>
			<p>Previously, we used <strong class="source-inline">k_core</strong> to remove the isolate nodes so that we could look at the remaining nodes more easily after dropping the center. In Marius’ ego network, we will skip that step.<a id="_idTextAnchor337"/> There are no isolates <span class="No-Break">to remove.</span></p>
			<h3>Alter list and amount</h3>
			<p>Let’s take a look<a id="_idIndexMarker616"/> at the alters that exist in Marius’ <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
sorted(ego_2.nodes)
['Bahorel', 'BaronessT', 'Bossuet', 'Combeferre', 'Cosette', 'Courfeyrac', 'Enjolras', 'Eponine', 'Feuilly', 'Gavroche', 'Gillenormand', 'Joly', 'LtGillenormand', 'Mabeuf', 'MlleGillenormand', 'Pontmercy', 'Thenardier', 'Tholomyes', 'Valjean']</pre>
			<p>Next, let’s get the number of nodes and edges the <span class="No-Break">easy way:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
nx.info(ego_2)
'Graph with 19 nodes and 57 edges'</pre>
			<p>Perfe<a id="_idTextAnchor338"/>ct. This is a very <span class="No-Break">simple network.</span></p>
			<h3>Important alters</h3>
			<p>Now, let’s see which alters sit in central positions. They are in powerful positions in <span class="No-Break">the network:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
degcent = nx.degree_centrality(ego_2)
degcent_df = pd.DataFrame(degcent, index=[0]).T
degcent_df.columns = ['degree_centrality']
degcent_df.sort_values('degree_centrality', inplace=True, ascending=False)
degcent_df.head(10)</pre>
			<p>This will give us our degree centralities. Let’s take a <span class="No-Break">closer look!</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer135" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_012.jpg" alt="Figure 8.12 – Marius’ ego network alters' degree centrality" width="390" height="562"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.12 – Marius’ ego network alters' degree centrality</p>
			<p>Wow, interesting. I would<a id="_idIndexMarker617"/> have suspected that Valjean would have been one of the most central nodes, but several people are ahead of him. Can you guess why? They are part of the densely connected community, and each of them is connected to more members of the ego network than <strong class="bold">Valjean</strong>. There should be a lot of information sharing in this community. Looking at Valjean’s placement now, I can see that he is a central figure, but he is less connected than the members of the densely <span class="No-Break">connected community.</span></p>
			<p>Do note that several nodes have the same centrality score. That can happen. Centrality scores are j<a id="_idTextAnchor339"/>ust the result of math, <span class="No-Break">not magic.</span></p>
			<h3>Ego network density</h3>
			<p>Finally, so <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>that we can compare ego networks, let’s calculate the <span class="No-Break">density score:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
nx.density(ego_2)
0.3333333333333333</pre>
			<p>Remember, Valjean’s ego network had a density of around <strong class="source-inline">0.12</strong>. Marius’ ego network is almost three times as dense. This would explain why it did not shatter into pieces when Marius’ central node was removed. A densely connected network is more resilient to breakage when central nodes are removed. This is important to remember when considering how real-world networks can be bolstered to provide greater availability. From <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>a human standpoint, this community will continue to exi<a id="_idTextAnchor340"/>st even when key nodes <span class="No-Break">are removed.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor341"/>Ego 3 – Gavroche</h2>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Les Miserables</em>, Gavroche<a id="_idIndexMarker620"/> is a young boy who lives on the streets <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>of Paris. Keeping that in mind, I would imagine that his ego network would look very different from an adult or someone who is much more co<a id="_idTextAnchor342"/>nnected in society. Let’s take <span class="No-Break">a look.</span></p>
			<h3>Full ego network</h3>
			<p>First, let’s visualize <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>the network with the <span class="No-Break">center intact:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ego_3 = nx.ego_graph(G, 'Gavroche')
draw_graph(ego_3, font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>This will render Gavroche’s <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer136" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_013.jpg" alt="Figure 8.13 – Gavroche’s ego network" width="1650" height="1013"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.13 – Gavroche’s ego network</p>
			<p>Interesting. Gavroche<a id="_idIndexMarker623"/> is well connected. Knowing that he is a child who lives on the streets, it’s interesting to see <strong class="bold">Child1</strong> and <strong class="bold">Child2</strong> listed at the top. The relationship between these three characters seems like it might be pretty interesting to understand. I can also see one person (<strong class="bold">MmeBurgon</strong>) whose node will become an isolate when Gavroche’s center node is dropped. Finally, I see what looks like two communities on the bottom left and right of the ego network. These should become more clear afte<a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>r dropping the center of <span class="No-Break">this network.</span></p>
			<h3>Ego network (dropped center)</h3>
			<p>Let’s drop <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>the center node and visualize the <span class="No-Break">network again:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ego_3 = nx.ego_graph(G, 'Gavroche', center=False)
draw_graph(ego_3, font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>This will<a id="_idIndexMarker625"/> render Gavroche’s ego network with the center dropped. This should make the separate communities more <span class="No-Break">easily identifiable:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer137" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_014.jpg" alt="Figure 8.14 – Gavroche’s ego network with the center dropped" width="1650" height="1013"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.14 – Gavroche’s ego network with the center dropped</p>
			<p>Perfect. As expected, one node became an isolate, the two children formed their own little cluster, and the remaining connected component contains two separate communities of people. It could be interesting to use a community detection algorithm on the largest cluster, but let’s move on. It’s clear, though, that Valjean is positioned between these <span class="No-Break">two communities.</span></p>
			<p>There’s not much point in removing isolates from this network, as th<a id="_idTextAnchor344"/>ere is only one, so let’s <span class="No-Break">push forward.</span></p>
			<h3>Alter list and amount</h3>
			<p>Let’s see <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>which other characters are a part of Gavroche’s ego network. In other words, I want to know who Gavroche knows. This will tell us which characters play a part in <span class="No-Break">his life:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Enter the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span><pre class="source-code">
sorted(ego_3.nodes)</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This simple line will give us all of the nodes in Gavroche’s ego network, <span class="No-Break">sorted alphabetically:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
['Babet', 'Bahorel', 'Bossuet', 'Brujon', 'Child1', 'Child2', 'Combeferre', 'Courfeyrac', 'Enjolras', 'Feuilly', 'Grantaire', 'Gueulemer', 'Javert', 'Joly', 'Mabeuf', 'Marius', 'MmeBurgon', 'MmeHucheloup', 'Montparnasse', 'Prouvaire', 'Thenardier', 'Valjean']</pre>
			<p>Great. I can see some familiar names, and I can clearly see <strong class="source-inline">Child1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Child2</strong> <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Next, let’s see how many nodes and edges exist in this network, doing this the <span class="No-Break">easy way:</span><pre class="source-code">
nx.info(ego_3)</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This should give us the <span class="No-Break">following output:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
'Graph with 22 nodes and 82 edges'</pre>
			<p>Wow. This is much more connected than the protagonist’s own ego network. Valjean’s ego network had <strong class="source-inline">36</strong> nodes and <strong class="source-inline">76</strong> edges. How do you think having fewer nodes and more edges will affect this network’s <span class="No-Break">density score?</span></p>
			<p>Before we<a id="_idTextAnchor345"/> get to that, let’s look <span class="No-Break">at centralities.</span></p>
			<h3>Important alters</h3>
			<p>Once again, let’s use degree centrality to see who the most connected people are in this ego network. These steps should start to look similar by now as they are. We are using different centralities to understand which nodes are important in <span class="No-Break">our network:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
degcent = nx.degree_centrality(ego_3)
degcent_df = pd.DataFrame(degcent, index=[0]).T
degcent_df.columns = ['degree_centrality']
degcent_df.sort_values('degree_centrality', inplace=True, ascending=False)
degcent_df.head(10)</pre>
			<p>This will<a id="_idIndexMarker627"/> give us a DataFrame of characters by degree centrality. Let’s <span class="No-Break">look closer:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer138" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_015.jpg" alt="Figure 8.15 – Gavroche’s ego network alters' degree centrality" width="386" height="568"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.15 – Gavroche’s ego network alters' degree centrality</p>
			<p>Wow, <strong class="bold">Enjoiras</strong> is one highly connected individual, and there are several other highly connected individuals as well. We can see them in<a id="_idTextAnchor346"/> the especially <span class="No-Break">well-connected community.</span></p>
			<h3>Ego network density</h3>
			<p>Finally, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>calculate density so that we can compare <span class="No-Break">ego networks:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
nx.density(ego_3)
0.354978354978355</pre>
			<p>That is very interesting. Gavroche is a kid who lives on the streets of Paris, but his social network is denser than any of the others that we have seen before. Valjean’s ego network density was around <strong class="source-inline">0.12</strong>, Marius’ was around <strong class="source-inline">0.33</strong>, and Gavroche’s is even higher. I never would have expected this. If I read this story, I am going to pay close attention to this character. He seems well connected, and<a id="_idTextAnchor347"/> I wonder how that plays out in <span class="No-Break">the story.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor348"/>Ego 4 – Joly</h2>
			<p>Near the<a id="_idIndexMarker629"/> beginning of this chapter, I chose four individuals for creating<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> ego networks. The first three had high PageRank scores, and I specifically chose someone with a lower PageRank score for the fourth, as I was hoping for a drastically different ego network than the <span class="No-Break">other three.</span></p>
			<p>Joly is a medicine student, and I wonder if this will affect his ego network. Students often socialize with other students, so I’ll i<a id="_idTextAnchor349"/>nvestigate a few of his <span class="No-Break">direct connections.</span></p>
			<h3>Full ego network</h3>
			<p>First, let’s create<a id="_idIndexMarker631"/> and visualize an ego network with the <span class="No-Break">center intact:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ego_4 = nx.ego_graph(G, 'Joly')
draw_graph(ego_4, font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>This will render Jolys <span class="No-Break">ego network.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer139" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_016.jpg" alt="Figure 8.16 – Joly’s ego network" width="1650" height="1013"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.16 – Joly’s ego network</p>
			<p>Wow. Very <a id="_idIndexMarker632"/>often, when visualizing networks, one will just jump out at me as being really unique. Of the four that we have done for this chapter, this one stands out. It does not look like a typical ego network. It is densely connected. Everybody in Joly’s ego network is well connected, and if we were to remove Joly’s node, the ego network would likely change very little. Before we do this, let’s take a look at a few of these individuals to see whether any of the others are either medicine students or members of Les Amis de l’ABC, which is an association of r<a id="_idTextAnchor350"/>evolutionary students that Joly is a <span class="No-Break">part of.</span></p>
			<h4>Bossuet</h4>
			<p>Bossuet Lesgle<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> is known as the unluckiest student and is a member of Les Amis de l’ABC. Being both a student and a member of the revolutionary students<a id="_idTextAnchor351"/>, it makes sense that he is connected <span class="No-Break">to Joly.</span></p>
			<h4>Enjoiras</h4>
			<p>Enjoiras is<a id="_idIndexMarker634"/> the leader of Les A<a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>mis de l’ABC. This connection also <span class="No-Break">makes sense.</span></p>
			<h4>Bahoret</h4>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor353"/>Bahoret is <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>another member of Les Amis <span class="No-Break">de l’ABC.</span></p>
			<h4>Gavroche</h4>
			<p>Gavroche <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>does not appear to be a member of Les Amis de l’ABC, but he assists in fighting <span class="No-Break">alongside them.</span></p>
			<p>Even without knowing much of the story or even much about the individual characters, we can easily identify members of the same community by inspectin<a id="_idTextAnchor354"/>g whole and ego networks as well <span class="No-Break">as communities.</span></p>
			<h3>Ego network (dropped center)</h3>
			<p>Now, let’s drop<a id="_idIndexMarker637"/> the center out of the ego network and see whether my hypothesis is correct that the ego network will not change very much because it is <span class="No-Break">densely connected:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ego_4 = nx.ego_graph(G, 'Joly', center=False)
draw_graph(ego_4, font_size=12, show_names=True, node_size=4, edge_width=1)</pre>
			<p>This will draw Joly’s ego network with the center dropped. If there are separate communities in this network, they will be shown separately as clusters. If there is only one community, then that community will show as a <span class="No-Break">single cluster:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer140" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17105_08_017.jpg" alt="Figure 8.17 – Joly’s ego network with the center dropped" width="1530" height="1054"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.17 – Joly’s ego network with the center dropped</p>
			<p>That’s very <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>interesting. With Joly removed, the ego network is definitely intact, and central individuals remain central. This is a resilient network, and as they are a group of revolutionaries, it would be in their best interests to be resilient for their revolution to stand <span class="No-Break">a chance.</span></p>
			<p>There are no isolates<a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>, so there is no point in denoising <span class="No-Break">this network.</span></p>
			<h3>Alter list and amount</h3>
			<p>Let’s get a<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> list of all of the individuals who are a part of this <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
sorted(ego_4.nodes)</pre>
			<p>This will give us a sorted list of characters who are part of this <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
['Bahorel', 'Bossuet', 'Combeferre', 'Courfeyrac', 'Enjolras', 'Feuilly', 'Gavroche', 'Grantaire', 'Mabeuf', 'Marius', 'MmeHucheloup', 'Prouvaire']</pre>
			<p>Compared<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> to the other ego networks, there are very <span class="No-Break">few individuals.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s get the number of nodes <span class="No-Break">and edges:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
nx.info(ego_4)</pre>
			<p>This should tell us a bit about the size and complexity of this <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
'Graph with 12 nodes and 57 edges'</pre>
			<p>This network has fewer nodes and fewer edges than other networks we’ve looked at, but <a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>it is visibly denser than any of the <span class="No-Break">other networks.</span></p>
			<h3>Important alters</h3>
			<p>Let’s take a look at the most important alters in the <span class="No-Break">ego network:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.18 – Joly’s ego network alters' degree centrality</p>
			<p>These<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> centralities are incredible, compared to the others that we have seen. The centrality scores of <strong class="source-inline">1.0</strong> for <strong class="bold">Bahorel</strong>, <strong class="bold">Gavroche</strong>, <strong class="bold">Bossuet</strong>, <strong class="bold">Courfeyrac</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Enjoiras</strong> means that they are connected to every single other person in this ego network. Even the individuals who do not have a centrality of <strong class="source-inline">1.0</strong> have very high-degree centralities. This is a well-connected network. <a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>How do you think that will affect the <span class="No-Break">density score?</span></p>
			<h3>Ego network density</h3>
			<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>calculate the density of this ego network. I suspect that this ego network will have a very <span class="No-Break">high density:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
nx.density(ego_4)
0.8636363636363636</pre>
			<p>That is incredibly high compared to the other <span class="No-Break">density scores:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Valjean’s ego network had a density of <span class="No-Break">around </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">0.12</strong></span></li>
				<li>Marius’s ego network was <span class="No-Break">around </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">0.33</strong></span></li>
				<li>Gavroche’s ego network was <span class="No-Break">around </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">0.35</strong></span></li>
				<li>Joly’s ego network was <span class="No-Break">around </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">0.86</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>That is dramatically <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>higher than any of the other <span class="No-Break">density scores.</span></p>
			<p>But this makes sense. Joly is both a student and a member of a revolutionary group. I would expect both of these groups to be w<a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>ell connected with other students <span class="No-Break">and revolutionaries.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Insights between egos</h2>
			<p>We’ve looked <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>at four different ego networks. We could have created an ego network for every single node in the network, but that would have been very time-consuming. When I do egocentric network analysis, I typically start by shortlisting several nodes of interest that I would like to investigate. I am typically looking for something, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who is <span class="No-Break">most connected</span></li>

				<li>Who has the <span class="No-Break">highest </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pagerank</strong></span></li>
				<li>Who has a tie to <span class="No-Break">known opposition</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this chapter, we investigated characters from the novel <em class="italic">Les Miserables</em>, so I purposefully chose individuals with the highest PageRank scores, as I anticipated that they’d have interesting ego networks. This strategy worked <span class="No-Break">very well.</span></p>
			<p>There are a few takeaways from all of this that I’d like to leave you with before concluding <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>First, it is possible to bolster a network by adding connections, and this will make it resilient to failure. If one node is removed, the network can remain intact and not shatter into pieces. This has implications for many things. For the flow of information to remain constant, an information-sharing network will want to be resilient to attack, for instance. Where else might having a network be resilient to failure be <span class="No-Break">of value?</span></li>
				<li>Second, removing the center node of an ego network can tell you a lot about the communities that exist in a network, as well as the resiliency of that network. When<a id="_idIndexMarker645"/> removing the center, which networks had isolates and islands? Which networks stayed completely intact? Which<a id="_idTextAnchor360"/> communities were we able <span class="No-Break">to see?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s see <span class="No-Break">what’s next.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>Identifying other research opportunities</h1>
			<p>When doing any<a id="_idIndexMarker646"/> kind of network analysis, it is important to know that there is always more that you can do; for instance, we could do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>We could embed additional information into the graph, such as weights or node types (teacher, student, revolutionary, and <span class="No-Break">so on)</span></li>
				<li>We could color nodes by node type for easier identification <span class="No-Break">of communities</span></li>
				<li>We could size nodes by the number of degrees or the centrality score to make it easier to identify <span class="No-Break">important nodes</span></li>
				<li>We could use directed networks to understand the directionality of <span class="No-Break">information sharing</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is always more that you can do, but it is important to know that enough is enough. You should use what you need. For this chapter, I originally got stuck trying to do too much, and I lost time trying to figure out how to do things that weren’t actually all that important to teaching this topic. Keep it simple and add only what you need and w<a id="_idTextAnchor362"/>hat is helpful. Add more as time permits if it <span class="No-Break">is useful.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor363"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned a new kind of network analysis, called egocentric network analysis. I tend to call egocentric networks <em class="italic">ego networks</em>, to be concise. We’ve learned that we don’t have to analyze a network as a whole. We can analyze it in parts, allowing us to investigate a node's placement in the context of its relationship with <span class="No-Break">another node.</span></p>
			<p>Personally, egocentric network analysis is my favorite form of network analysis because I enjoy investigating the level of the individual things that exist in a network. Whole network analysis is useful as a broad map, but with egocentric network analysis, you can gain a really intimate understanding of the various relationships between things that exist in a network. I hope you enjoyed reading and learning from this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope this inspires you to <span class="No-Break">learn more.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will dive into community <span class="No-Break">detection algorithms!</span></p>
