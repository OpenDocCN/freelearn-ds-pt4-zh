    strategies and techniques before moving on to building a holistic picture of how
    every piece of the data science puzzle fits together. Throughout the book, you’ll
    discover statistical models with which you can control and navigate even the densest
    or sparsest of datasets and learn how to create powerful visualizations that communicate
    the stories hidden in your data.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B19488_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015)*, Data Science Terminology*,
    describes the basic terminology used by data scientists. We will cover the differences
    between often-confused terms as well as looking at examples of each term used
    in order to truly understand how to communicate in the language of data science.
    We will begin by looking at the broad term *data science* and then, little by
    little, get more specific until we arrive at the individual subdomains of data
    science, such as machine learning and statistical inference. This chapter will
    also look at the three main areas of data science, which are math, programming,
    and domain expertise. We will look at each one individually and understand the
    uses of each. We will also look at the basic Python packages and the syntax that
    will be used throughout the book.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B19488_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor047)*, Types of Data*, deals with
    data types and the way data is observed. We will explore the different levels
    of data as well as the different forms of data. Specifically, we will understand
    the differences between structured/unstructured data, quantitative/qualitative
    data, and more.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B19488_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086)*, The Five Steps of Data Science*,
    deals with the data science process as well as data wrangling and preparation.
    We will go into the five steps of data science and give examples of the process
    at every step of the way. After we cover the five steps of data science, we will
    turn to data wrangling, which is the data exploration/preparation stage of the
    process. In order to best understand these principles, we will use extensive examples
    to explain each step. I will also provide tips to look for when exploring data,
    including looking for data on different scales, categorical variables, and missing
    data. We will use pandas to check for and fix all of these things.'

    over the elementary mathematical skills needed by any data scientist. We will
    dive into functional analysis and use matric algebra as well as calculus to show
    and prove various outcomes based on real-world data problems.'

- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B19488_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor139)*, Impossible or Improbable
    – A Gentle Introduction to Probability*, focuses heavily on the basic probability
    that is required for data science. We will derive results from data using probability
    rules and begin to see how we view real-world problems using probability. This
    chapter will be highly practical and Python will be used to code the examples.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B19488_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor170)*, Advanced Probability*, is
    where we explore how to use Python to solve more complex probability problems
    and also look at a new type of probability called Bayesian inference. We will
    use these theorems to solve real-world data scenarios such as weather predictions.'

- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B19488_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor192)*,* *What Are the Chances? An
    Introduction to Statistics*, is on basic statistics, which is required for data
    science. We will also explore the types of statistical errors, including type
    I and type II errors, using examples. These errors are as essential to our analysis
    as the actual results. Errors and their different types allow us to dig deeper
    into our conclusions and avoid potentially disastrous results. Python will be
    used to code up statistical problems and results.'

- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B19488_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor214)*, Advanced Statistics*, is
    where normalization is key. Understanding why and how we normalize data will be
    crucial. We will cover basic plotting, such as scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms.
    This chapter will also get into statistical modeling using data. We will not only
    define the concept as using math to model a real-world situation, but we will
    also use real data in order to extrapolate our own statistical models. We will
    also discuss overfitting. Python will be used to code up statistical problems
    and results.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B19488_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor242)*, Communicating Data*, deals
    with the different ways of communicating results from our analysis. We will look
    at different presentation styles as well as different visualization techniques.
    The point of this chapter is to take our results and be able to explain them in
    a coherent, intelligible way so that anyone, whether they are data-savvy or not,
    may understand and use our results. Much of what we will discuss will be how to
    create effective graphs through labels, keys, colors, and more. We will also look
    at more advanced visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates plots.'

- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B19488_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272)*,* *How to Tell if Your Toaster
    is Learning – Machine Learning Essentials*, focuses on machine learning as a part
    of data science. We will define the different types of machine learning and see
    examples of each kind. We will specifically cover areas in regression, classification,
    and unsupervised learning. This chapter will cover what machine learning is and
    how it is used in data science. We will revisit the differences between machine
    learning and statistical modeling and how machine learning is a broader category
    of the latter. Our aim will be to utilize statistics and probability in order
    to understand and apply essential machine learning skills to practical industries
    such as marketing. Examples will include predicting star ratings of restaurant
    reviews, predicting the presence of disease, spam email detection, and much more.
    This chapter focuses more on statistical and probabilistic models. The next chapter
    will deal with models that do not fall into this category. We will also focus
    on metrics that tell us how accurate our models are. We will use metrics in order
    to conclude results and make predictions using machine learning.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 11*](B19488_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor307)*,* *Predictions Don’t Grow
    on Trees, or Do They?*, focuses heavily on machine learning that is not considered
    a statistical or probabilistic model. These constitute models that cannot be contained
    in a single equation, such as linear regression or naïve Bayes. The models in
    this chapter are, while still based on mathematical principles, more complex than
    a single equation. The models include KNN, decision trees, and an introduction
    to unsupervised clustering. Metrics will become very important here as they will
    form the basis for measuring our understanding and our models. We will also peer
    into some of the ethics of data science in this chapter. We will see where machine
    learning can perhaps boundaries in areas such as privacy and advertising and try
    to draw a conclusion about the ethics of predictions.'

    models. We will navigate the world of open source models and achieve state-of-the-art
    performance in NLP and vision tasks.'

    can lead to biased models. We will also see how we can identify bias as early
    as possible and catch new biases that arise in existing models.'
