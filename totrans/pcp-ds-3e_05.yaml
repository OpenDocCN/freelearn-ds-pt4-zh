    A **procedure** is an act that leads to a result, for example, throwing a die
    or visiting a website.
  prefs: []

    heads on a coin flip or leaving a website after only four seconds. A simple event
    is an outcome/event of a procedure that cannot be broken down further. For example,
    rolling two dice can be broken down into two simple events: rolling die 1 and
    rolling die 2.'
