    techniques. The point of this chapter is to take our results and be able to explain

- en: Being able to conduct experiments and manipulate data in a coding language is
    not enough to conduct practical and applied data science. This is because data
    science is, generally, only as good as how it is used in practice. For instance,
    a medical data scientist might be able to predict the chance of a tourist contracting
    malaria in developing countries with >98% accuracy; however, if these results
    are published in a poorly marketed journal and online mentions of the study are
    minimal, their groundbreaking results that could potentially prevent deaths would
    never truly see the light of day.

- en: For this reason, communication of results is arguably as important as the results
    themselves. A famous example of poor management of the distribution of results
    is the case of Gregor Mendel. Mendel is widely recognized as one of the founders
    of modern genetics. However, his results (including data and charts) were not
    well adopted until after his death. Mendel even sent them to Charles Darwin, who
    largely ignored Mendel’s papers, which were written in unknown Moravian journals.

    that can make anyone in the field more aware and effective in their communication

    overall work performance may decrease. That is a correlation. It doesn’t seem
    quite right to suggest that watching TV is the actual cause of a decrease in the
    quality of work performed. It might seem more plausible to suggest that there
    is a third factor, perhaps hours of sleep every night, that might answer this
    question. Perhaps, watching more TV decreases the amount of time you have for
    sleep, which in turn limits your work performance. The number of hours of sleep

    and the last graph is exactly the reason why data scientists must believe that.
    Just because there exists a mathematical correlation between variables does not
    mean they have causation between them. There might be confounding factors between
    them or they might just not have anything to do with each other!

- en: Simpson’s paradox is a formal reason for why we need to take confounding variables
    seriously. The paradox states that a correlation between two variables can be
    completely reversed when we take different factors into account. This means that
    even if a graph shows a positive correlation, these variables can become *anti-correlated*
    when another factor (most likely a confounding one) is taken into consideration.
    This can be very troublesome to statisticians.

    *Page A* was better in *both* categories but was worse overall. That’s the beauty
    and, also, the horrifying nature of the paradox. This happens because of the unbalanced
    classes between the four groups.

    at different hours of the day and the West Coast people were more likely to see
    *Page B*, while the East Coast people were more likely to see *Page A*.

    power to correlated variables. There might be confounding variables that have
    to be examined. Therefore, if you are able to reveal a correlation between two
    variables (such as website category and conversion rate or TV consumption and
    work performance), then you should absolutely try to isolate as many variables
    as possible that might be the reason for the correlation, or can at least help
    explain your case further.

    causality is, usually, through randomized experiments, such as the ones we saw
    in [*Chapter 8*](B19488_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor214), *Advanced Statistics*. One
    would have to split up the population groups into randomly sampled groups and
    run hypothesis tests to conclude, with a degree of certainty, that there is a
    true causation between variables.
