<p class="mce-root"><span>In <em>R Bioinformatics Cookbook</em>, you will encounter common and not-so-common challenges in the bioinformatics domain using real-world examples.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>This book will use a recipe-based approach to help you perform practical research and analysis in computational biology with R. You will gain an understanding of your data through the analysis of <kbd>Bioconductor</kbd>, <kbd>ggplot</kbd>, and the <kbd>tidyverse</kbd> library in bioinformatics. You will be introduced to a number of essential tools in <kbd>Bioconductor</kbd> so that you can understand and carry out protocols in RNAseq, phylogenetics, genomics, and sequence analysis. You will also learn how machine learning techniques can be used in the bioinformatics domain. You will develop key computational skills, such as developing workflows in R Markdown and designing your own packages for efficient and reproducible code reuse.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>By the end of this book, you'll have a solid understanding of the most important and widely used techniques in bioinformatic analysis, as well as the tools you'll need to work with real biological data.</span></p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>We'll look at using the </span><kbd>ape</kbd><span> and </span><kbd>treeio</kbd><span> packages to get tree data into and out of R. </span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Some of the dependencies rely on encapsulated Java code, so you'll need to install a <strong>Java Runtime Environment</strong> (<strong>JRE</strong>) for your system.</span><span>"</span></p>
