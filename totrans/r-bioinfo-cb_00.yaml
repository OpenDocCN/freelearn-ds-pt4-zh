- en: In *R Bioinformatics Cookbook*, you will encounter common and not-so-common
    challenges in the bioinformatics domain using real-world examples.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will use a recipe-based approach to help you perform practical research
    and analysis in computational biology with R. You will gain an understanding of
    your data through the analysis of `Bioconductor`, `ggplot`, and the `tidyverse`
    library in bioinformatics. You will be introduced to a number of essential tools
    in `Bioconductor` so that you can understand and carry out protocols in RNAseq,
    phylogenetics, genomics, and sequence analysis. You will also learn how machine
    learning techniques can be used in the bioinformatics domain. You will develop
    key computational skills, such as developing workflows in R Markdown and designing
    your own packages for efficient and reproducible code reuse.
