			<p>Pachyderm is a distributed version control platform for building end-to-end data science workflows. Since its creation in 2016, Pachyderm has become a go-to solution for large and small organizations. The core functionality of Pachyderm is open source and has a vivid community of engineers around it. This book walks you through basic and advanced examples of Pachyderm usage. This book will help you get started quickly and integrate a reliable data science solution into your infrastructure. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Reproducible Data Science with Pachyderm</em> provides a clear overview of Pachyderm, as well as instructions on how to install and run Pachyderm in the cloud, and how to use the Pachyderm <strong class="bold">Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) version â€“ Pachyderm Hub. This book has practical examples of data science technics running on a Pachyderm cluster.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for new and more experienced data scientists and machine learning engineers who want to build scalable infrastructures for their data science projects. Basic knowledge of Python programming and Kubernetes will be beneficial. Familiarity with GoLang is nice to have.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You will need to have the latest Pachyderm version installed on your computer. All operations were tested using Pachyderm 2.0 on macOS. However, they should work with future version releases too. If you are on Windows, all operations must be performed in <strong class="bold">Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (<strong class="bold">WSL</strong>).</p>
