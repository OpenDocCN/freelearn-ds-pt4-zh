- en: Pachyderm is a distributed version control platform for building end-to-end
    data science workflows. Since its creation in 2016, Pachyderm has become a go-to
    solution for large and small organizations. The core functionality of Pachyderm
    is open source and has a vivid community of engineers around it. This book walks
    you through basic and advanced examples of Pachyderm usage. This book will help
    you get started quickly and integrate a reliable data science solution into your
    infrastructure.

    All operations were tested using Pachyderm 2.0 on macOS. However, they should
    work with future version releases too. If you are on Windows, all operations must
    be performed in **Windows Subsystem for Linux** (**WSL**).

    Console. Pachyderm provides a free trial license for first-time users. However,
    most examples will work without an enterprise license. To test Pachyderm Notebooks
    in [*Chapter 11*](B17085_11_Final_SB_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor241), *Using Pachyderm
    Notebooks*, you will need to create a Pachyderm Hub account.
