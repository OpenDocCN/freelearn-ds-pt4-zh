    Pipeline Specification*, we learned about the Pachyderm pipeline specification
    and what parameters you can configure in it. The pipeline specification is the
    most critical configuration piece of your pipeline, along with your code. In this
    chapter, we will learn how to create a Pachyderm pipeline that performs image
    processing. We will walk through all the steps that are involved in this process,
    including creating the Pachyderm repository, creating a pipeline, viewing the
    results of our computations, and adding an extra step to our original pipeline.

- en: A Pachyderm pipeline is a technique that processes data from a Pachyderm input
    repository or repositories and uploads it to a Pachyderm output repository. Every
    time new data is uploaded to the input repository, the pipeline automatically
    processes it. Every time new data lands in the repository, it is recorded as a
    commit hash and can be accessed, rerun, or analyzed later. Therefore, a pipeline
    is an essential component of the Pachyderm ecosystem that ensures the reproducibility
    of your data science workloads.

    that will draw a contour on an image. A contour is an outline that represents
    the shape of an object. This is a useful technique that is often applied to image
    processing pipelines.
  prefs: []

    quality of images, transform an image into another image, extract various information
    about an image, and so on. With machine learning, you can set up pipelines that
    can determine objects in an image, create a histogram of an image, and so on.

    the Python programming language.

    *Pachyderm Basics*, a Pachyderm repository is a location inside of a Pachyderm

    you will need to have a separate pipeline specification and a Docker image if
    you are using one. In this section, we will add another step to our image processing
    workflow. We will use the `skimage.exposure.histogram` module to create histograms
    of all the images we have in our `contour` output repository.

    the image, such as the number of pixels, their intensity, and other information.
    Because we represent images as numerical data, we can create a histogram for each
    of the images we processed in the first step of our workflow – the contour pipeline.
    In this new step of the workflow, we will create histograms for each image that
    has landed in the `contour` output repository and save them in the `histogram`
    output repository in PNG format.

- en: In this chapter, you successfully created your first Pachyderm repository, pipeline,
    and even extended it with another pipeline step. We used scikit-image, Matplotlib,
    and NumPy to create contours on images stored in Pachyderm repositories and created
    histograms for all of these images. This is the first step in understanding how
    Pachyderm works. In Pachyderm, you'll work with pipelines quite a lot. As you
    have already noticed, you can put any code in your pipeline. Although most of
    the examples in this book will use Python, you can use any programming language
    of your choice.

    ingest data into Pachyderm and export it to outside systems, how to make changes
    to a pipeline's code, how to tune various parameters, and other important Pachyderm
    operations.
